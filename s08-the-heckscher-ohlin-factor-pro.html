<span class="title-prefix">Chapter 5</span> The Heckscher-Ohlin (Factor Proportions) Model</h1>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch05_p01">The Heckscher-Ohlin (H-O; aka the factor proportions) model is one of the most important models of international trade. It expands upon the Ricardian model largely by introducing a second factor of production. In its two-by-two-by-two variant, meaning two goods, two factors, and two countries, it represents one of the simplest general equilibrium models that allows for interactions across factor markets, goods markets, and national markets simultaneously.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch05_p02">These interactions across markets are one of the important economics lessons displayed in the results of this model. With the H-O model, we learn how changes in supply or demand in one market can feed their way through the factor markets and, with trade, the national markets and influence both goods and factor markets at home and abroad. In other words, all markets are everywhere interconnected.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch05_p03">Among the important results are that international trade can improve economic efficiency but that trade will also cause a redistribution of income between different factors of production. In other words, some will gain from trade, some will lose, but the net effects are still likely to be positive.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch05_p04">The end of the chapter discusses the specific factor model, which represents a cross between the H-O model and the immobile factor model. The implications for income distribution and trade are highlighted.</p>

    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch05_s01_p01">The factor proportions model was originally developed by two Swedish economists, Eli Heckscher and his student Bertil Ohlin, in the 1920s. Many elaborations of the model were provided by Paul Samuelson after the 1930s, and thus sometimes the model is referred to as the Heckscher-Ohlin-Samuelson (HOS) model. In the 1950s and 1960s, some noteworthy extensions to the model were made by Jaroslav Vanek, and so occasionally the model is called the Heckscher-Ohlin-Vanek model. Here we will simply call all versions of the model either the Heckscher-Ohlin (H-O) model, or simply the more generic “factor proportions model.”</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch05_s01_p02">The H-O model incorporates a number of realistic characteristics of production that are left out of the simple Ricardian model. Recall that in the simple Ricardian model only one factor of production, labor, is needed to produce goods and services. The productivity of labor is assumed to vary across countries, which implies a difference in technology between nations. It was the difference in technology that motivated advantageous international trade in the model.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch05_s01_p03">The standard H-O model begins by expanding the number of factors of production from one to two. The model assumes that labor and capital are used in the production of two final goods. Here, capital refers to the physical machines and equipment that are used in production. Thus machine tools, conveyers, trucks, forklifts, computers, office buildings, office supplies, and much more are considered capital.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch05_s01_p04">All productive capital must be owned by someone. In a capitalist economy, most of the physical capital is owned by individuals and businesses. In a socialist economy, productive capital would be owned by the government. In most economies today, the government owns some of the productive capital, but private citizens and businesses own most of the capital. Any person who owns common stock issued by a business has an ownership share in that company and is entitled to dividends or income based on the profitability of the company. As such, that person is a capitalist—that is, an owner of capital.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch05_s01_p05">The H-O model assumes private ownership of capital. Use of capital in production will generate income for the owner. We will refer to that income as capital “rents.” Thus, whereas the worker earns “wages” for his or her efforts in production, the capital owner earns rents.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch05_s01_p06">The assumption of two productive factors, capital and labor, allows for the introduction of another realistic feature in production: differing factor proportions both across and within industries. When one considers a range of industries in a country, it is easy to convince oneself that the proportion of capital to labor applied in production varies considerably. For example, steel production generally involves large amounts of expensive machines and equipment spread over perhaps hundreds of acres of land, but it also uses relatively few workers. (Note that <em class="emphasis">relative</em> here means relative to other industries.) In the tomato industry, in contrast, harvesting requires hundreds of migrant workers to hand-pick and collect each fruit from the vine. The amount of machinery used in this process is relatively small.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch05_s01_p07">In the H-O model, we define the ratio of the quantity of capital to the quantity of labor used in a production process as the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">capital-labor ratio</a><span class="glossdef">The ratio of the quantity of capital to the quantity of labor used in a production process.</span></span>. We imagine, and therefore assume, that different industries producing different goods have different capital-labor ratios. It is this ratio (or proportion) of one factor to another that gives the model its generic name: the factor proportions model.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch05_s01_p08">In a model in which each country produces two goods, an assumption must be made as to which industry has the larger capital-labor ratio. Thus if the two goods that a country can produce are steel and clothing and if steel production uses more capital per unit of labor than is used in clothing production, we would say the steel production is <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">capital intensive</a><span class="glossdef">An industry is capital intensive relative to another industry if it has a higher capital-labor ratio in the production process.</span></span> relative to clothing production. Also, if steel production is capital intensive, then it implies that clothing production must be <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">labor intensive</a><span class="glossdef">An industry is labor intensive relative to another industry if it has a higher labor-capital ratio in the production process.</span></span> relative to steel.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch05_s01_p09">Another realistic characteristic of the world is that countries have different quantities—that is, endowments—of capital and labor available for use in the production process. Thus some countries like the United States are well endowed with physical capital relative to their labor force. In contrast, many less-developed countries have much less physical capital but are well endowed with large labor forces. We use the ratio of the aggregate endowment of capital to the aggregate endowment of labor to define relative factor abundancy between countries. Thus if, for example, the United States has a larger ratio of aggregate capital per unit of labor than France’s ratio, we would say that the United States is capital abundant relative to France. By implication, France would have a larger ratio of aggregate labor per unit of capital and thus France would be labor abundant relative to the United States.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch05_s01_p10">The H-O model assumes that the only differences between countries are these variations in the relative endowments of factors of production. It is ultimately shown that (1) trade will occur, (2) trade will be nationally advantageous, and (3) trade will have characterizable effects on prices, wages, and rents when the nations differ in their relative factor endowments and when different industries use factors in different proportions.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch05_s01_p11">It is worth emphasizing here a fundamental distinction between the H-O model and the Ricardian model. Whereas the Ricardian model assumes that production technologies differ between countries, the H-O model assumes that production technologies are the same. The reason for the identical technology assumption in the H-O model is perhaps not so much because it is believed that technologies are really the same, although a case can be made for that. Instead, the assumption is useful in that it enables us to see precisely how differences in resource endowments are sufficient to cause trade and it shows what impacts will arise entirely due to these differences.</p>
    <div class="section" id="fwk-61960-ch05_s01_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">The Main Results of the H-O Model</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch05_s01_s01_p01">There are four main theorems in the H-O model: the Heckscher-Ohlin (H-O) theorem, the Stolper-Samuelson theorem, the Rybczynski theorem, and the factor-price equalization theorem. The Stolper-Samuelson and Rybczynski theorems describe relationships between variables in the model, while the H-O and factor-price equalization theorems present some of the key results of the model. The application of these theorems also allows us to derive some other important implications of the model. Let us begin with the H-O theorem.</p>
        <div class="section" id="fwk-61960-ch05_s01_s01_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">The Heckscher-Ohlin Theorem</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch05_s01_s01_s01_p01">The H-O theorem predicts the pattern of trade between countries based on the characteristics of the countries. The H-O theorem says that a capital-abundant country will export the capital-intensive good, while the labor-abundant country will export the labor-intensive good.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch05_s01_s01_s01_p02">Here’s why. A country that is <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">capital abundant</a><span class="glossdef">A country is capital abundant relative to another country if it has a higher capital endowment per labor endowment than the other country.</span></span> is one that is well endowed with capital relative to the other country. This gives the country a propensity for producing the good that uses relatively more capital in the production process—that is, the capital-intensive good. As a result, if these two countries were not trading initially—that is, they were in autarky—the price of the capital-intensive good in the capital-abundant country would be bid down (due to its extra supply) relative to the price of the good in the other country. Similarly, in the country that is <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">labor abundant</a><span class="glossdef">A country is labor abundant relative to another country if it has a higher labor endowment per capital endowment than the other country.</span></span>, the price of the labor-intensive good would be bid down relative to the price of that good in the capital-abundant country.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch05_s01_s01_s01_p03">Once trade is allowed, profit-seeking firms will move their products to the markets that temporarily have the higher price. Thus the capital-abundant country will export the capital-intensive good since the price will be temporarily higher in the other country. Likewise, the labor-abundant country will export the labor-intensive good. Trade flows will rise until the prices of both goods are equalized in the two markets.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch05_s01_s01_s01_p04">The H-O theorem demonstrates that differences in resource endowments as defined by national abundancies are one reason that international trade may occur.</p>

        <div class="section" id="fwk-61960-ch05_s01_s01_s02">
            <h2 class="title editable block">The Stolper-Samuelson Theorem</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch05_s01_s01_s02_p01">The <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Stolper-Samuelson theorem</a><span class="glossdef">A theorem that specifies how changes in output prices affect factor prices in the H-O model. It states that an increase in the price of a good will cause an increase in the price of the factor used intensively in that industry and a decrease in the price of the other factor.</span></span> describes the relationship between changes in output prices (or prices of goods) and changes in factor prices such as wages and rents within the context of the H-O model. The theorem was originally developed to illuminate the issue of how tariffs would affect the incomes of workers and capitalists (i.e., the distribution of income) within a country. However, the theorem is just as useful when applied to trade liberalization.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch05_s01_s01_s02_p02">The theorem states that if the price of the capital-intensive good rises (for whatever reason), then the price of capital—the factor used intensively in that industry—will rise, while the wage rate paid to labor will fall. Thus, if the price of steel were to rise and if steel were capital intensive, the rental rate on capital would rise, while the wage rate would fall. Similarly, if the price of the labor-intensive good were to rise, then the wage rate would rise, while the rental rate would fall.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch05_s01_s01_s02_p03">The theorem was later generalized by Ronald Jones, who constructed a magnification effect for prices in the context of the H-O model. The magnification effect allows for analysis of any change in the prices of both goods and provides information about the magnitude of the effects on wages and rents. Most importantly, the magnification effect allows one to analyze the effects of price changes on real wages and real rents earned by workers and capital owners. This is instructive since real returns indicate the purchasing power of wages and rents after accounting for price changes and thus are a better measure of well-being than the wage rate or rental rate alone.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch05_s01_s01_s02_p04">Since prices change in a country when trade liberalization occurs, the magnification effect can be applied to yield an interesting and important result. A movement to free trade will cause the real return of a country’s relatively abundant factor to rise, while the real return of the country’s relatively scarce factor will fall. Thus if the United States and France are two countries that move to free trade and if the United States is capital abundant (while France is labor abundant), then capital owners in the United States will experience an increase in the purchasing power of their rental income (i.e., they will gain), while workers will experience a decline in the purchasing power of their wage income (i.e., they will lose). Similarly, workers will gain in France, but capital owners will lose.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch05_s01_s01_s02_p05">What’s more, the country’s abundant factor benefits regardless of the industry in which it is employed. Thus capital owners in the United States would benefit from trade even if their capital is used in the declining import-competing sector. Similarly, workers would lose in the United States even if they are employed in the expanding export sector.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch05_s01_s01_s02_p06">The reasons for this result are somewhat complicated, but the gist can be given fairly easily. When a country moves to free trade, the price of its exported goods will rise, while the price of its imported goods will fall. The higher prices in the export industry will inspire profit-seeking firms to expand production. At the same time, the import-competing industry, suffering from falling prices, will want to reduce production to cut its losses. Thus capital and labor will be laid off in the import-competing sector but will be in demand in the expanding export sector. However, a problem arises in that the export sector is intensive in the country’s abundant factor—let’s say capital. This means that the export industry wants relatively more capital per worker than the ratio of factors that the import-competing industry is laying off. In the transition there will be an excess demand for capital, which will bid up its price, and an excess supply of labor, which will bid down its price. Hence, the capital owners in both industries experience an increase in their rents, while the workers in both industries experience a decline in their wages.</p>

        <div class="section" id="fwk-61960-ch05_s01_s01_s03">
            <h2 class="title editable block">The Factor-Price Equalization Theorem</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch05_s01_s01_s03_p01">The factor-price equalization theorem says that when the prices of the output goods are equalized between countries, as when countries move to free trade, the prices of the factors (capital and labor) will also be equalized between countries. This implies that free trade will equalize the wages of workers and the rents earned on capital throughout the world.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch05_s01_s01_s03_p02">The theorem derives from the assumptions of the model, the most critical of which are the assumptions that the two countries share the same production technology and that markets are perfectly competitive. In a perfectly competitive market, factors are paid on the basis of the value of their marginal productivity, which in turn depends on the output prices of the goods. Thus when prices differ between countries, so will their marginal productivities and hence so will their wages and rents. However, once goods’ prices are equalized, as they are in free trade, the value of marginal products is also equalized between countries and hence the countries must also share the same wage rates and rental rates.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch05_s01_s01_s03_p03">Factor-price equalization formed the basis for some arguments often heard in the debates leading up to the approval of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) between the United States, Canada, and Mexico. Opponents of NAFTA feared that free trade with Mexico would lower U.S. wages to the level in Mexico. Factor-price equalization is consistent with this fear, although a more likely outcome would be a reduction in U.S. wages coupled with an increase in Mexican wages.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch05_s01_s01_s03_p04">Furthermore, we should note that factor-price equalization is unlikely to apply perfectly in the real world. The H-O model assumes that technology is the same between countries in order to focus on the effects of different factor endowments. If production technologies differ across countries, as we assumed in the Ricardian model, then factor prices would not equalize once goods’ prices equalize. As such, a better interpretation of the factor-price equalization theorem applied to real-world settings is that free trade should cause a tendency for factor prices to move together if some of the trade between countries is based on differences in factor endowments.</p>

        <div class="section" id="fwk-61960-ch05_s01_s01_s04">
            <h2 class="title editable block">The Rybczynski Theorem</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch05_s01_s01_s04_p01">The <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Rybczynski theorem</a><span class="glossdef">A theorem that specifies how changes in endowments affect production levels in the H-O model. It states that an increase in a country’s endowment of a factor will cause an increase in the output of the good that uses that factor intensively and a decrease in the output of the other good.</span></span> demonstrates the relationship between changes in national factor endowments and changes in the outputs of the final goods within the context of the H-O model. Briefly stated, it says that an increase in a country’s endowment of a factor will cause an increase in output of the good that uses that factor intensively and a decrease in the output of the other good. In other words, if the United States experiences an increase in capital equipment, then that would cause an increase in output of the capital-intensive good (steel) and a decrease in the output of the labor-intensive good (clothing). The theorem is useful in addressing issues such as investment, population growth and hence labor force growth, immigration, and emigration, all within the context of the H-O model.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch05_s01_s01_s04_p02">The theorem was also generalized by Ronald Jones, who constructed a magnification effect for quantities in the context of the H-O model. The magnification effect allows for analysis of any change in both endowments and provides information about the magnitude of the effects on the outputs of the two goods.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Aggregate Economic Efficiency</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch05_s01_s01_s05_p01">The H-O model demonstrates that when countries move to free trade, they will experience an increase in aggregate efficiency. The change in prices will cause a shift in production of both goods in both countries. Each country will produce more of its export good and less of its import good. Unlike the Ricardian model, however, neither country will necessarily specialize in production of its export good. Nevertheless, the production shifts will improve productive efficiency in each country. Also, due to the changes in prices, consumers, in the aggregate, will experience an improvement in consumption efficiency. In other words, national welfare will rise for both countries when they move to free trade.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch05_s01_s01_s05_p02">However, this does not imply that everyone benefits. As the Stolper-Samuelson theorem shows, the model clearly demonstrates that some factor owners will experience an increase in their real incomes, while others will experience a decrease in their factor incomes. Trade will generate winners and losers. The increase in national welfare essentially means that the sum of the gains to the winners will exceed the sum of the losses to the losers. For this reason, economists often apply the compensation principle.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch05_s01_s01_s05_p03">The compensation principle states that as long as the total benefits exceed the total losses in the movement to free trade, then it must be possible to redistribute income from the winners to the losers such that everyone has at least as much as they had before trade liberalization occurred.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch05_s01_s01_s05_p04">Note that the “standard” H-O model refers to the case of two countries, two goods, and two factors of production. The H-O model has been extended to many countries, many goods, and many factors, but most of the exposition in this text, and by economists in general, is in reference to the standard case.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch05_s02_s01_p01">Perfect competition in all markets means that the following conditions are assumed to hold.</p>
        <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch05_s02_s01_l01">
            <li>Many firms produce output in each industry such that each firm is too small for its output decisions to affect the market price. This implies that when choosing output to maximize profit, each firm takes the price as given or exogenous.</li>
            <li>Firms choose output to maximize profit. The rule used by perfectly competitive firms is to choose the output level that equalizes the price (<em class="emphasis">P</em>) with the marginal cost (<em class="emphasis">MC</em>). That is, set <em class="emphasis">P = MC</em>.</li>
            <li>Output is homogeneous across all firms. This means that goods are identical in all their characteristics such that a consumer would find products from different firms indistinguishable. We could also say that goods from different firms are perfect substitutes for all consumers.</li>
            <li>There is free entry and exit of firms in response to profits. Positive profit sends a signal to the rest of the economy and new firms enter the industry. Negative profit (losses) leads existing firms to exit, one by one, out of the industry. As a result, in the long run economic profit is driven to zero in the industry.</li>
            <li>Information is perfect. For example, all firms have the necessary information to maximize profit and to identify the positive profit and negative profit industries.</li>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch05_s02_s08_s02_p01">Two different assumptions can be applied in an H-O model: fixed and variable proportions. A fixed proportions assumption means that the capital-labor ratio in each production process is fixed. A variable proportions assumption means that the capital-labor ratio can adjust to changes in the wage rate for labor and the rental rate for capital.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch05_s02_s08_s02_p02">Fixed proportions are more simplistic and also less realistic assumptions. However, many of the primary results of the H-O model can be demonstrated within the context of fixed proportions. Thus the fixed proportions assumption is useful in deriving the fundamental theorems of the H-O model. The variable proportions assumption is more realistic but makes solving the model significantly more difficult analytically. To derive the theorems of the H-O model under variable proportions often requires the use of calculus.</p>

The effect allows for changes in both endowments simultaneously and provides information about the magnitude of the effects. The Rybczynski theorem is one special case of the magnification effect that assumes one of the endowments is held fixed.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch05_s08_p01">The production possibility frontier can be derived in the case of variable proportions by using the same labor and capital constraints used in the case of fixed proportions, but with one important adjustment. Under variable proportions, the unit factor requirements are functions of the wage-rental ratio (<em class="emphasis">w</em>/<em class="emphasis">r</em>). This implies that the capital-labor ratios (which are the ratios of the unit factor requirements) in each industry are also functions of the wage-rental ratio. If there is a change in the equilibrium (for some reason) such that the wage-rental rate rises, then labor will become relatively more expensive compared to capital. Firms would respond to this change by reducing their demand for labor and raising their demand for capital. In other words, firms will substitute capital for labor and the capital-labor ratio will rise in each industry. This adjustment will allow the firm to maintain minimum production costs and thus the highest profit possible. This is the first important distinction between variable and fixed proportions.</p>

All points on the PPF will maintain full employment of both labor and capital resources. The slope of a line tangent to the PPF (such as the line through point <em class="emphasis">A</em>) represents the quantity of steel that must be given up to produce another unit of clothing. As such, the slope of the PPF is the opportunity cost of producing clothing. Since the slope becomes steeper as more and more clothing is produced (as when moving production from point <em class="emphasis">A</em> to <em class="emphasis">B</em>), we say that there is increasing opportunity cost. This means that more steel must be given up to produce one more unit of clothing at point <em class="emphasis">B</em> than at point <em class="emphasis">A</em> in the figure.

The model also assumes that the aggregate preferences are the same across countries. The only difference that exists between the two countries in the model is a difference in resource endowments. We assume that the United States has relatively more capital per worker in the aggregate than does France. This means that the United States is capital abundant compared to France. Similarly, France, by implication, has more workers per unit of capital in the aggregate and thus is labor abundant compared to the United States.

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch05_s09_s01_p03">Next, suppose that labor and capital are shifted between the two countries. Suppose labor is moved from the United States to France, while capital is moved from France to the United States. This will have two effects. First, the United States will now have more capital and less labor, and France will have more labor and less capital than it did initially. This implies that <em class="emphasis">K</em>/<em class="emphasis">L&gt; K</em>∗/<em class="emphasis">L</em>∗, or that the United States is capital abundant and France is labor abundant. Second, the two countries’ PPFs will shift. To show how, we apply the Rybczynski theorem.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch05_s09_s01_p04">The United States experiences an increase in <em class="emphasis">K</em> and a decrease in <em class="emphasis">L</em>. Both changes will cause an increase in output of the good that uses capital intensively (i.e., steel) and a decrease in output of the other good (clothing). The Rybczynski theorem is derived assuming that output prices remain constant. Thus if prices did remain constant, production would shift from point <em class="emphasis">A</em> to <em class="emphasis">B</em> and the U.S. PPF would shift from the blue <em class="emphasis">PPF</em><sub class="subscript">0</sub> to the green <em class="emphasis">PPF</em> in <a class="xref" href="#fwk-61960-ch05_s09_s01_f01">Figure 5.7 "Endowment Differences and the PPF"</a>.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch05_s09_s01_p05">Using the new PPF, we can deduce what the U.S. production point and price ratio would be in autarky given the increase in the capital stock and the decline in the labor stock. Consumption could not occur at point <em class="emphasis">B</em> because first, the slope of the PPF at <em class="emphasis">B</em> is the same as the slope at <em class="emphasis">A</em> because the Rybczynski theorem was used to identify it, and second, homothetic preferences imply that the indifference curve passing through <em class="emphasis">B</em> must have a steeper slope because it lies along a steeper ray from the origin.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch05_s09_s01_p10">Any difference in autarky prices between the United States and France is sufficient to induce profit-seeking firms to trade. The higher price of clothing in the United States (in terms of steel) will induce firms in France to export clothing to the United States to take advantage of the higher price. The higher price of steel in France (in terms of clothing) will induce U.S. steel firms to export steel to France. Thus the United States, abundant in capital relative to France, exports steel, the capital-intensive good. France, abundant in labor relative to the United States, exports clothing, the labor-intensive good. This is the H-O theorem. Each country exports the good intensive in the country’s abundant factor.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch05_s12_p01">The term “distributive effects” refers to the distribution of income gains, losses, or both across individuals in the economy. In the Heckscher-Ohlin (H-O) model, there are only two distinct groups of individuals: those who earn their income from labor (workers) and those who earn their income from capital (capitalists). In actuality, many individuals may earn income from both sources. For example, a worker who has deposits in a pension plan that invests in mutual funds has current wage income, but changes in rental rates will affect his or her future capital income. This person’s income stream thus depends on both the return to labor and the return to capital.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch05_s12_p02">For the moment, we shall consider the distributive effects on workers who depend solely on labor income and capitalists who depend solely on capital income. Later we shall consider what happens if individuals receive income from both sources.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch05_s12_p03">To measure gains or losses to workers and capitalists, we must evaluate the effects of free trade on their real incomes. Increases in nominal income are not sufficient to know whether an individual is better off since the price of exportable goods will also rise when a country moves to free trade. By assessing the change in real income, we can determine how the purchasing power of workers and capitalists is affected by the move to free trade.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch05_s12_p04">Suppose there are two countries, the United States and France, producing two goods, clothing and steel, using two factors, capital and labor, according to an H-O model. Suppose steel production is capital intensive and the United States is capital abundant. This implies that clothing production is labor intensive and France is labor abundant.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch05_s12_p05">If these two countries move from autarky to free trade, then, according to the H-O theorem, the United States will export steel to France and France will export clothing to the United States. Also, the price of each country’s export good will rise relative to each country’s import good. Thus in the United States, <em class="emphasis">P</em><sub class="subscript"><em class="emphasis">S</em></sub><em class="emphasis">/P</em><sub class="subscript"><em class="emphasis">C</em></sub> rises, while in France <em class="emphasis">P</em><sub class="subscript"><em class="emphasis">C</em></sub><em class="emphasis">/P</em><sub class="subscript"><em class="emphasis">S</em></sub> rises.</p>

Workers are made absolutely better off from free trade. Individuals in France who receive income solely from capital are able to purchase less of each good in free trade relative to autarky. Capitalists are made absolutely worse off from free trade.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch05_s12_p17">These results imply that both countries will experience a redistribution of income when moving from autarky to free trade. Some individuals will gain from trade, while others will lose. Distinguishing the winners and losers more generally can be done by referring to the fundamental basis for trade in the model. Trade occurs because of differences in endowments between countries. The United States is assumed to be capital abundant, and when free trade occurs, capitalists in the United States benefit. France is assumed to be labor abundant, and when free trade occurs, workers in France benefit. Thus, in the H-O model, a country’s relatively abundant factor gains from trade, while a country’s relatively scarce factor loses from trade.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch05_s12_p18">It is worth noting that the redistribution of income is between factors of production and not between industries. The H-O model assumes that workers and capital are homogenous and are costlessly mobile between industries. This implies that all workers in the economy receive the same wage and all capital receives the same rent. Thus if workers benefit from trade in the H-O model, it means that all workers in both industries benefit. In contrast to the immobile factor model, one need not be affiliated with the export industry in order to benefit from trade. Similarly, if capital loses from trade, then capitalists suffer losses in both industries. One need not be affiliated with the import industry to suffer losses.</p>

            <li>In the H-O model, when countries implement free trade, output prices, wages, and rents on capital change.</li>
            <li>If a country is abundant in capital (labor), then a movement to free trade will increase real rents (wages) and decrease real wages (rents). In other words, income is redistributed from workers (capital owners) to capital owners (workers).</li>

        </ol>
    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch05_s13_p01">The Heckscher-Ohlin model generates several important conclusions for a country that moves from autarky to free trade:</p>
    <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch05_s13_l02">
        <li>Aggregate national welfare rises—this is displayed as achieving a higher level of utility on a set of national indifference curves.</li>
        <li>Income is redistributed among individuals within the economy—this is shown by applying the magnification effect for prices to the price changes that arise in moving from autarky to free trade. It is shown that the real income of a country’s relatively abundant factor rises while the real income of a country’s relatively scarce factor falls.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch05_s13_p02">A reasonable question at this juncture, then, is whether the gains to some individuals exceed the losses to others and, if so, whether it is possible to redistribute income to ensure that everyone is absolutely better off with trade than he or she was in autarky. In other words, is it possible for the winners from free trade to <em class="emphasis">compensate</em> the losers in such a way that everyone is left better off than he or she was in autarky?</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch05_s13_p03">The answer to this is yes in most circumstances. The primary reason is that the move to free trade improves production and consumption efficiency, which can make it possible for the country to consume more of both goods with trade compared to autarky.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch05_s13_p04">Consider <a class="xref" href="#fwk-61960-ch05_s13_f01">Figure 5.10 "Compensation in the H-O Model"</a>. Point <em class="emphasis">A</em> on the PPF represents the autarky production and consumption point for this economy. The shaded region represents the set of consumption points that provides at least as much of one good and more of the other relative to the autarky equilibrium. Suppose that in free trade production moves to <em class="emphasis">P</em>1 and consumption moves to <em class="emphasis">C</em>1. Since <em class="emphasis">C</em>1 lies within the shaded region, the country consumes more clothing and more steel in the aggregate than it had consumed in autarky. However, in moving from autarky to free trade, some factors have experienced increases in income, while others have suffered losses. This means that some individuals consume less of both goods in free trade, while others consume more of both goods.</p>

    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch05_s13_p05">However, since there are more of both goods in the aggregate, it is conceivable that government intervention, which takes some of the extra goods away from the winners, could sufficiently compensate the losers and leave everyone better off in trade.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch05_s13_p06">The possibility of an effective redistribution depends in some circumstances on the way in which the redistribution is implemented. For example, taxes and subsidies could redistribute income from winners to losers but would simultaneously affect the domestic prices of the goods, which would affect consumption decisions and so on. With the secondary effects of taxes and subsidies, it becomes uncertain whether a redistribution policy would work. For this reason, economists will often talk about making a <em class="emphasis">lump-sum</em> redistribution or transfer. Lump-sum transfers are analogous to the transfers from rich to poor made by the infamous character Robin Hood. Essentially, goods must be stolen away from the winners, after they have made their consumption choices, and given to the losers, also after they have made their consumption choices. Furthermore, the winners and losers must not know or expect that a redistribution will be made, lest that knowledge affect their consumption choices beforehand. Thus a lump-sum redistribution is exactly what Robin Hood achieves. He steals from the wealthy, after they’ve purchased their goods, and gives to the poor, who were not expecting such a gift.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch05_s13_p07">Although lump-sum compensations make perfect sense in theory, or in principle, it is worth noting how impractical they are. There is no government that has tried to institutionalize this process by creating a Division of Robin Hoodian Transfers. In practice, lump-sum transfers rarely occur.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch05_s13_p08">Compensation may not always be as straightforward as in the previous example, however. Another possible outcome in a free trade equilibrium is for more of one good to be consumed but less of another relative to autarky. In other words, the free trade consumption point may occur at a point like <em class="emphasis">C</em>2 in <a class="xref" href="#fwk-61960-ch05_s13_f02">Figure 5.11 "Compensation Difficulties"</a>. In this case, it would not be possible to compensate everyone with as much steel as they had in autarky since the economy is consuming less steel in the free trade equilibrium. However, even in this case it is potentially possible to arrange a redistribution scheme. The reason is that the economy could potentially choose a consumption point along the red line segment, as at point <em class="emphasis">C</em>1 Since the red segment lies in the range in which more of both goods is available, compensation to make everyone better off with trade remains a possibility.</p>

<span class="title-prefix">5.14</span> Factor-Price Equalization</h2>
    <div class="learning_objectives editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch05_s14_n01">
        <h3 class="title">Learning Objective</h3>

            <li>Understand the relationship between wages and rents across countries in the Heckscher-Ohlin (H-O) model.</li>
        </ol>
    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch05_s14_p01">The fourth major theorem that arises out of the Heckscher-Ohlin (H-O) model is called the factor-price equalization theorem. Simply stated, the theorem says that when the prices of the output goods are equalized between countries as they move to free trade, then the prices of the factors (capital and labor) will also be equalized between countries. This implies that free trade will equalize the wages of workers and the rents earned on capital throughout the world.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch05_s14_p02">The theorem derives from the assumptions of the model, the most critical of which is the assumption that the two countries share the same production technology and that markets are perfectly competitive.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch05_s14_p03">In a perfectly competitive market, the return to a factor of production depends on the value of its marginal productivity. The marginal productivity of a factor, like labor, in turn depends on the amount of labor being used as well as the amount of capital. As the amount of labor rises in an industry, labor’s marginal productivity falls. As the amount of capital rises, labor’s marginal productivity rises. Finally, the <em class="emphasis">value</em> of productivity depends on the output price commanded by the good in the market.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch05_s14_p04">In autarky, the two countries face different prices for the output goods. The difference in prices alone is sufficient to cause a deviation in wages and rents between countries because it affects the marginal productivity. However, in addition, in a variable proportions model the difference in wages and rents also affects the capital-labor ratios in each industry, which in turn affects the marginal products. All of this means that for various reasons the wage and rental rates will differ between countries in autarky.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch05_s14_p05">Once free trade is allowed in outputs, output prices will become equal in the two countries. Since the two countries share the same marginal productivity relationships, it follows that only one set of wage and rental rates can satisfy these relationships for a given set of output prices. Thus free trade will equalize goods’ prices and wage and rental rates.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch05_s14_p06">Since the two countries face the same wage and rental rates, they will also produce each good using the same capital-labor ratio. However, because the countries continue to have different quantities of factor endowments, they will produce different quantities of the two goods.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch05_s14_p07">This result contrasts with the Ricardian model. In that model, production technologies are assumed to be different in the two countries. As a result, when countries move to free trade, real wages remain different from each other; the country with higher productivities will have higher real wages.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch05_s14_p08">In the real world, it is difficult to know whether production technologies are different, similar, or identical. Supporting identical production technology, one could argue that state-of-the-art capital can be moved anywhere in the world. On the other hand, one might counter by saying that just because the equipment is the same doesn’t mean the workforces will operate the equipment similarly. There will likely always remain differences in organizational abilities, workforce habits, and motivations.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch05_s14_p09">One way to apply these model results to the real world might be to say that to the extent that countries share identical production capabilities, there will be a tendency for factor prices to converge as freer trade is realized.</p>

            <li>Learn the basic assumptions and results of the specific factor (SF) model.</li>
        </ol>
    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch05_s15_p01">The specific factor (SF) model was originally discussed by Jacob Viner, and it is a variant of the Ricardian model. Hence the model is sometimes referred to as the Ricardo-Viner model. The model was later developed and formalized mathematically by Ronald Jones (1971)<span class="footnote" id="fwk-surantrade-fn05_001">See R. W. Jones, “A Three-Factor Model in Theory, Trade and History,” in <em class="emphasis">Trade, Balance of Payments and Growth</em>, ed. J. N. Bhagwati, R. W. Jones, R. A. Mundell, and J. Vanek (Amsterdam: North-Holland Publishing Co., 1971).</span> and Michael Mussa (1974)<span class="footnote" id="fwk-surantrade-fn05_002">Michael Mussa, “Tariffs and the Distribution of Income: The Importance of Factor Specificity, Substitutability, and Intensity in the Short and Long-Run<em class="emphasis">,” Journal of Political Economy</em>, 82, no. 6 (1974): 1191–1203.</span>. Jones referred to it as the two-good, three-factor model. Mussa developed a simple graphical depiction of the equilibrium that can be used to portray some of the model’s results. It is this view that is presented in most textbooks.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch05_s15_p02">The model’s name refers to its distinguishing feature—that one factor of production is assumed to be “specific” to a particular industry. A <em class="emphasis">specific</em> factor is one that is stuck in an industry or is immobile between industries in response to changes in market conditions. A factor may be immobile between industries for a number of reasons. Some factors may be specifically designed (in the case of capital) or specifically trained (in the case of labor) for use in a particular production process. In these cases, it may be impossible, or at least difficult or costly, to move these factors across industries. See <a class="xref" href="fwk-61960-ch04#fwk-61960-ch04">Chapter 4 "Factor Mobility and Income Redistribution"</a>, <a class="xref" href="fwk-61960-ch04_s02#fwk-61960-ch04_s02">Section 4.2 "Domestic Factor Mobility"</a> and <a class="xref" href="fwk-61960-ch04#fwk-61960-ch04">Chapter 4 "Factor Mobility and Income Redistribution"</a>, <a class="xref" href="fwk-61960-ch04_s03#fwk-61960-ch04_s03">Section 4.3 "Time and Factor Mobility"</a> for more detailed reasons for factor immobility.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch05_s15_p03">The SF model is designed to demonstrate the effects of trade in an economy in which one factor of production is specific to an industry. The most interesting results pertain to the changes in the distribution of income that would arise as a country moves to free trade.</p>
    <div class="section" id="fwk-61960-ch05_s15_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Basic Assumptions</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch05_s15_s01_p01">The SF model assumes that an economy produces two goods using two factors of production, capital and labor, in a perfectly competitive market. One of the two factors of production, typically capital, is assumed to be specific to a particular industry—that is, it is completely immobile. The second factor, labor, is assumed to be freely and costlessly mobile between the two industries. Because capital is immobile, one could assume that capital in the two industries is different, or differentiated, and thus is not substitutable in production. Under this interpretation, it makes sense to imagine that there are really three factors of production: labor, specific capital in Industry 1, and specific capital in Industry 2.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch05_s15_s01_p02">These assumptions place the SF model squarely between an immobile factor model and the Heckscher-Ohlin (H-O) model. In an immobile factor model, all the factors of production are specific to an industry and cannot be moved. In an H-O model, both factors are assumed to be freely mobile—that is, neither factor is specific to an industry. Since the mobility of factors in response to any economic change is likely to increase over time, we can interpret the immobile factor model results as short-run effects, the SF model results as medium-run effects, and the H-O model results as long-run effects.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch05_s15_s01_p03">Production of Good 1 requires the input of labor and capital specific to Industry 1. Production of Good 2 requires labor and capital specific to Industry 2. There is a fixed endowment of sector-specific capital in each industry as well as a fixed endowment of labor. Full employment of labor is assumed, which implies that the sum of the labor used in each industry equals the labor endowment. Full employment of sector-specific capital is also assumed; however, in this case the sum of the capital used in all the <em class="emphasis">firms</em> within the industry must equal the endowment of sector-specific capital.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch05_s15_s01_p04">The model assumes that firms choose an output level to maximize profit, taking prices and wages as given. The equilibrium condition will have firms choosing an output level, and hence a labor usage level, such that the market-determined wage is equal to the value of the marginal product of the last unit of labor. The <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">value of the marginal product</a><span class="glossdef">The increment in revenue that a firm will obtain by adding another unit of labor to its production process.</span></span> is the increment of revenue that a firm will obtain by adding another unit of labor to its production process. It is found as the product of the price of the good in the market and the marginal product of labor. Production is assumed to display diminishing returns because the fixed stock of capital means that each additional worker has less capital to work with in production. This means that each additional unit of labor will add a smaller increment to output, and since the output price is fixed, the value of the marginal product declines as labor usage rises. When all firms behave in this way, the allocation of labor between the two industries is uniquely determined.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch05_s15_s01_p05">The production possibility frontier (PPF) will exhibit increasing opportunity costs. This is because expansion of one industry is possible by transferring labor out of the other industry, which must therefore contract. Due to the diminishing returns to labor, each additional unit of labor switched will have a smaller effect on the expanding industry and a larger effect on the contracting industry. This means that the graph of the PPF in the SF model will look similar to the PPF in the variable proportion H-O model. However, in relation to a model in which both factors were freely mobile, the SF model PPF will lie everywhere inside the H-O model PPF. This is because the lack of mobility of one factor inhibits firms from taking full advantage of efficiency improvements that would be possible if both factors can be freely reallocated.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="fwk-61960-ch05_s15_s02">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Specific Factor Model Results</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch05_s15_s02_p01">The SF model is used to demonstrate the effects of economic changes on labor allocation, output levels, and factor returns. Many types of economic changes can be considered, including a movement to free trade, the implementation of a tariff or quota, growth of the labor or capital endowment, or technological changes. This section will focus on effects that result from a change in prices. In an international trade context, prices might change when a country liberalizes trade or when it puts into place additional barriers to trade.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch05_s15_s02_p02">When the model is placed into an international trade context, differences of some sort between countries are needed to induce trade. The standard approach is to assume that countries differ in the amounts of the specific factors used in each industry relative to the total amount of labor. This would be sufficient to cause the PPFs in the two countries to differ and could potentially generate trade. Under this assumption, the SF model is a simple variant of the H-O model. However, the results of the model are not sensitive to this assumption. Trade may arise due to differences in endowments, differences in technology, differences in demands, or some combination. The results derive as long as there is a price change, for whatever reason.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch05_s15_s02_p03">So suppose, in a two-good SF model, that the price of one good rises. If the price change is the result of trade liberalization, then the industry whose price rises is in the export sector. The price increase would set off the following series of adjustments. First, higher export prices would initially raise profits in the export sector since wages and rents may take time to adjust. The value of the marginal product in exports would rise above the current wage, and that would induce the firms to hire more workers and expand output. However, to induce the movement of labor, the export firms would have to raise the wage that they pay. Since all labor is alike (the model assumes labor is homogeneous), the import-competing sector would have to raise its wages in step so as not to lose all of its workers. The higher wages would induce the expansion of output in the export sector (the sector whose price rises) and a reduction in output in the import-competing sector. The adjustment would continue until the wage rises to a level that equalizes the value of the marginal product in both industries.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch05_s15_s02_p04">The return to capital in response to the price change would vary across industries. In the import-competing industry, lower revenues and higher wages would combine to reduce the return to capital in that sector. However, in the export sector, greater output and higher prices would combine to raise the return to capital in that sector.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch05_s15_s02_p05">The real effects of the price change on wages and rents are somewhat more difficult to explain but are decidedly more important. Remember that absolute increases in the wage, or the rental rate on capital, does not guarantee that the recipient of that income is better off, since the price of one of the goods is also rising. Thus the more relevant variables to consider are the real returns to capital (real rents) in each industry and the real return to labor (real wages).</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch05_s15_s02_p06">Ronald Jones (1971) derived a magnification effect for prices in the SF model that demonstrated the effects on the real returns to capital and labor in response to changes in output prices. In the case of an increase in the price of an export good and a decrease in the price of an import good, as when a country moves to free trade, the magnification effect predicts the following impacts:</p>
        <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch05_s15_s02_l01">
            <li>The real return to capital in the export industry will rise with respect to purchases of both exports and imports.</li>
            <li>The real return to capital in the import-competing industry will fall with respect to purchases of both exports and imports.</li>
            <li>The real wage to workers in both industries will rise with respect to purchases of the import good and will fall with respect to purchases of the export good.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch05_s15_s02_p07">This result means that when a factor of production, like capital, is immobile between industries, a movement to free trade will cause a redistribution of income. Some individuals—owners of capital in the export industry—will benefit from free trade. Other individuals—owners of capital in the import-competing industries—will lose from free trade. Workers, who are freely mobile between industries, may gain or may lose since the real wage in terms of exports rises while the real wage in terms of imports falls. If workers’ preferences vary, then those individuals who have a relatively high demand for the export good will suffer a welfare loss, while those individuals who have a relatively strong demand for imports will experience a welfare gain.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch05_s15_s02_p08">Notice that the clear winners and losers in this model are distinguishable by industry. As in the immobile factor model, the factor specific to the export industry benefits, while the factor specific to the import-competing industry loses.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch05_s16_p01">Consider an economy with two perfectly competitive industries, textiles and steel. Suppose the output of both products requires labor and capital as factor inputs. However, we’ll imagine the capital used in textile production consists of equipment such as looms, while the capital used in steel production requires equipment such as blast furnaces. Since each type of capital is designed for use in a specific production process, we call it “specific capital.” We can imagine that if the capital from one industry were shifted to another, its productivity in the new industry would be zero. Simply imagine the usefulness of a blast furnace in textile production and you should see the point! Thus for capital to remain fully employed, it must remain in the same industry—it is immobile, or stuck in its respective industry.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch05_s16_p02">We assume labor, on the other hand, is homogenous and perfectly freely mobile between the two industries. This will imply that a firm’s choice problem is reduced to the decision of how much labor to hire and how much to produce to maximize its profits, given that it has a fixed amount of capital available to use. We’ll assume for simplicity that the capital stock in each industry is exogenously fixed and there is no investment in new capital.</p>
    <div class="section" id="fwk-61960-ch05_s16_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Single-Firm Equilibrium in the Specific Factor Model</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch05_s16_s01_p01">In this context, a firm will maximize it profits when it produces a level of output such that the wage it must pay to workers is equal to the value of the marginal product at the chosen level of output. This is written in equation form for a textile firm as follows:</p>
        <span class="informalequation block"><em class="emphasis">w</em> = <em class="emphasis">P</em><sub class="subscript"><em class="emphasis">T</em></sub> <em class="emphasis">MP</em><sub class="subscript"><em class="emphasis">T</em></sub>.</span>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch05_s16_s01_p02">The left-hand side of the equation represents the hourly wage the firm pays its workers. The right-hand side is the value of the marginal product, which consists of the product of the market price of output (<em class="emphasis">P</em><sub class="subscript"><em class="emphasis">T</em></sub>) and the marginal product of production (<em class="emphasis">MP</em><sub class="subscript"><em class="emphasis">T</em></sub>). The marginal product, in turn, represents the additional output that can be obtained by increasing the labor input by one unit. For example, if <em class="emphasis">MP</em><sub class="subscript"><em class="emphasis">T</em></sub> = 10, this means that by adding one more hour of labor, ten additional meters of cloth could be produced. The units of the expression <em class="emphasis">MP</em><sub class="subscript"><em class="emphasis">T</em></sub> are meters of cloth per hour of labor (m/hr.). When multiplied by the price, measured as dollars per meter, the product, <em class="emphasis">P</em><sub class="subscript"><em class="emphasis">T</em></sub> <em class="emphasis">MP</em><sub class="subscript"><em class="emphasis">T</em></sub>, yields <em class="emphasis">the number of dollars that could be earned per hour of additional labor applied in production</em>. This then is the definition of the value of the marginal product in this context. It is measured in dollars per hour, the same as the wage is measured—a good thing since they must be equal to each other!</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch05_s16_s01_p03">To see why this condition will hold when the firm maximizes profit, we will graph these expressions in <a class="xref" href="#fwk-61960-ch05_s16_s01_f01">Figure 5.12 "Specific Factor Model—Single-Firm Equilibrium"</a>, which depicts the value of a marginal product line for a representative textile firm, <em class="emphasis">VMP</em><sub class="subscript"><em class="emphasis">T</em></sub> = <em class="emphasis">P</em><sub class="subscript"><em class="emphasis">T</em></sub> <em class="emphasis">MP</em><sub class="subscript"><em class="emphasis">T</em></sub>, and the market wage rate, <em class="emphasis">w</em><sub class="subscript"><em class="emphasis">T</em></sub>, with respect to the labor supply.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch05_s16_s01_p04">The wage is assumed to be exogenous to each firm and is independent of the labor supply.

        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch05_s16_s01_p05">The value of the marginal product is a decreasing function of labor. This means that at higher levels of labor usage, each additional unit of labor applied to production adds fewer units of output. The intuition for this is straightforward. Imagine more and more workers being assigned to use the same machine in a production process. Each additional worker may help in the production process and add output (thus <em class="emphasis">MP</em> &gt; 0), but as more and more are added, overcrowding will set in and each person will find less and less to do that is helpful. Thus the marginal product will fall. Since we draw the value of the marginal product line under the assumption that there is a fixed amount of specific capital in the industry, the same overcrowding argument applies at the larger industry scale.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch05_s16_s01_p06">The position of the <em class="emphasis">VMP</em> line is dependent on the market price and the amount of specific capital, both assumed to be exogenous. If the price of the product rises (falls), the <em class="emphasis">VMP</em> line shifts upward (downward). The same applies for changes in the amount of specific capital. If the amount of specific capital in the industry were to rise (fall), the <em class="emphasis">VMP</em> line would shift upward (downward).</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch05_s16_s01_p07">The profit-maximizing choice of labor input by the industry is determined at level <em class="emphasis">LE</em> on the horizontal axis, where the wage <em class="emphasis">w</em><sub class="subscript"><em class="emphasis">T</em></sub> is equal to the value of the marginal product <em class="emphasis">VMP</em><sub class="subscript"><em class="emphasis">T</em></sub> at point <em class="emphasis">E</em>. To see why, consider what it would mean if the industry chose a different labor input, say <em class="emphasis">L</em>1. At <em class="emphasis">L</em>1, <em class="emphasis">VMP</em><sub class="subscript"><em class="emphasis">L</em></sub><sup class="superscript">1</sup> &gt; <em class="emphasis">w</em><sub class="subscript"><em class="emphasis">T</em></sub>. This says that the additional revenue earned by expanding labor input by one unit exceeds the additional cost of adding one more unit of labor. Thus adding one more unit of labor must raise profit, which means that <em class="emphasis">L</em>1 cannot be the profit-maximizing choice—it must lie to the right of <em class="emphasis">L</em>1. Next consider labor input <em class="emphasis">L</em>2. At <em class="emphasis">L</em>2, <em class="emphasis">VMP</em><sub class="subscript"><em class="emphasis">L</em></sub><sub class="subscript">2</sub> &lt; <em class="emphasis">w</em><sub class="subscript"><em class="emphasis">T</em></sub>. This says that the additional revenue earned by expanding labor input by one unit is less than the cost of adding one more unit of labor. Thus adding one more unit of labor must lower profit, which means that <em class="emphasis">L</em>2 cannot be the profit-maximizing choice—it must lie to the left of <em class="emphasis">L</em>2. Finally, consider labor input <em class="emphasis">LE</em>. At <em class="emphasis">LE</em>, <em class="emphasis">VMP</em><sub class="subscript"><em class="emphasis">LE</em></sub> = <em class="emphasis">w</em><sub class="subscript"><em class="emphasis">T</em></sub>. This says that the additional revenue earned by expanding labor input by one unit equals the additional cost of adding one more unit of labor. Thus adding one more unit of labor has no effect on profit, which means that <em class="emphasis">LE</em> must be the profit-maximizing choice.</p>

The product of these two, <em class="emphasis">w</em><sub class="subscript"><em class="emphasis">T</em></sub><em class="emphasis">LE</em>, represents the total amount of money that must be paid to workers in the industry and is referred to as the wage bill.

This corresponds to the area under the <em class="emphasis">VMP</em><sub class="subscript"><em class="emphasis">T</em></sub> line between 0 and <em class="emphasis">LE</em> units of labor. Without the use of calculus, it is difficult to describe why this is so. Nonetheless, since the <em class="emphasis">VMP</em> gives the additional revenue earned for each additional unit of labor, one can imagine beginning back at <em class="emphasis">L</em> = 0 and increasing labor in small increments. The vertical distance to the <em class="emphasis">VMP</em> line would be added to the total revenue for every increment in labor. Adding each of these vertical lines together between <em class="emphasis">L</em>= 0 and <em class="emphasis">L</em> = <em class="emphasis">L</em><sup class="superscript"><em class="emphasis">E</em></sup> yields total revenue earned by the firm and is given by the total shaded area.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch05_s16_s02_p03">Finally, since there are only two factors of production—labor and specific capital—it must follow that the total revenue equals the sum of the wage bill and the capital bill, where the capital bill represents the total amount of money paid to the capital owners.

The immediate effect will be to raise the value of the marginal product of steel, shifting up <em class="emphasis">VMP</em><sub class="subscript"><em class="emphasis">S</em></sub><sub class="subscript">1</sub> to <em class="emphasis">VMP</em><sub class="subscript"><em class="emphasis">S</em></sub><sub class="subscript">2</sub>.

At <em class="emphasis">F</em>, labor allocated to steel production will have risen to <em class="emphasis">O</em><sub class="subscript"><em class="emphasis">S</em></sub><em class="emphasis">B</em>, while labor used in textiles will have fallen to <em class="emphasis">O</em><sub class="subscript"><em class="emphasis">T</em></sub><em class="emphasis">B</em>. The equilibrium wage increases to <em class="emphasis">w</em><sub class="subscript"><em class="emphasis">2</em></sub>.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch05_s16_s04_p04">The intuition for these changes follows from the underlying dynamic effects. At first, when the price of steel rises, the wage and rental rates remain fixed. This means steel revenue rises while costs remain the same, stimulating an increase in steel profits. Positive profit, in a perfectly competitive market, induces new entry of firms into steel production, expansion of current firms in the industry, or both. To expand, steel must induce workers to move over from textile production. This requires an increase in the wage since labor demand temporarily exceeds labor supply. To prevent all the labor from shifting to steel, the textile industry must raise the wage to its workers as well. As labor shifts from textiles to steel and as the wage rises, the costs of production in steel and textiles rise. In steel, this erodes the temporary profits it was making. Textiles respond to the higher costs by cutting production and releasing workers. Remember, there is no ability to expand capital inputs in steel since we assume steel’s capital stock is fixed exogenously in size, and due to specificity, capital cannot be moved in from the textile industry. In the end, industry profits are driven to zero in both industries once the wage rises sufficiently.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch05_s16_s04_p05">Our prime concern, however, is the effect of the price increase on the factor payments or returns. In other words, how are wages and rental rates on capital affected by the steel price increase? The answer for wages is already shown. We can see that wages rise for workers in both industries. However, we care about not just how the nominal (money) wage changes but, more importantly, how the <em class="emphasis">real</em> wage changes. In other words, we need to identify how the purchasing power of wages changes when the price of steel increases. We also want to know how the real rental rates change.</p>

        <h3 class="title">Learning Objective</h3>
        <ol class="orderedlist" id="fwk-61960-ch05_s17_l01">
            <li>Integrate the results of income redistribution from three separate models: the immobile factor model, the specific factor (SF) model, and the Heckscher-Ohlin (H-O) model.</li>
        </ol>
    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch05_s17_p01">A number of trade models demonstrate that movements to free trade will cause a redistribution of income. The immobile factor model concludes that income will be redistributed from workers in the import-competing industry to workers in the export industry. The specific factor (SF) model concludes that owners of capital in the export sector will gain at the expense of capital owners in the import-competing sector and that the effects on workers in both industries are ambiguous. The Heckscher-Ohlin (H-O) model demonstrates that income will be redistributed from owners of a country’s scarce factor, who will lose, to owners of a country’s abundant factor, who will gain.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch05_s17_p02">One of the key distinctions between these models is the degree of factor mobility. The immobile factor model represents one extreme, in which factors are stuck in one industry and cannot move between sectors. The H-O model represents another extreme, in which factors can move freely and costlessly between sectors. The SF model represents an intermediate special case in which one factor is completely immobile and the other is completely mobile.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch05_s17_p03">As was discussed in detail in <a class="xref" href="fwk-61960-ch04#fwk-61960-ch04">Chapter 4 "Factor Mobility and Income Redistribution"</a>, <a class="xref" href="fwk-61960-ch04_s02#fwk-61960-ch04_s02">Section 4.2 "Domestic Factor Mobility"</a>, different factors of production will likely have different degrees of mobility. Some factors are easily adaptable to other industries. For example, accountants are needed in all businesses, and trucks can be used to transport tomatoes or software. Other factors are so specialized that they cannot be easily adapted for use in other industries. Machinery is often carefully designed for a particular production process and cannot be applied elsewhere.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch05_s17_p04">However, the adaptability of any productive factor is likely to change over time, with mobility rising the longer the amount of time that elapses (see <a class="xref" href="fwk-61960-ch04#fwk-61960-ch04">Chapter 4 "Factor Mobility and Income Redistribution"</a>, <a class="xref" href="fwk-61960-ch04_s03#fwk-61960-ch04_s03">Section 4.3 "Time and Factor Mobility"</a>). Thus, if a country were to suddenly liberalize trade, in the very short run—perhaps up to a few weeks—most of the productive factors would not adjust to the change in prices. This is the situation reflected in the immobile factor model. After a few months or more, the most adaptable factors of production would begin to move from the import-competing sectors to the export sectors, while the least adaptable factors would remain stuck in their respective industries. This situation is characterized by the SF model, in which one factor is freely mobile but the other is immobile. Finally, in the very long run—perhaps after several years or more—we might expect all factors to have adapted to the changed economic conditions, either by moving to another industry or by moving out of productive activity, as with retired workers and capital equipment. This situation is depicted in the H-O model.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch05_s17_p05">Thus, by piecing together the results of these models, we can evaluate how income redistribution is likely to change dynamically over time in response to any shock to the system, such as a movement toward trade liberalization or free trade.</p>
    <div class="section" id="fwk-61960-ch05_s17_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Scenario Setup/Assumptions</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch05_s17_s01_p01">Consider a country that produces two goods, which we simply label the import good and the export good, respectively. Production of these two goods requires two factors of production, capital and labor. Assume that the country in question is capital abundant vis-à-vis its trading partner and that the export good is capital intensive relative to the import good. In general, we maintain all the assumptions of the H-O model, with one exception: we will assume that in the short run, capital and labor are completely immobile between industries; in the medium run, labor is freely mobile but capital remains immobile; and in the long run, both labor and capital are freely and costlessly mobile between industries.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch05_s17_s01_p02">We will consider the effects of trade liberalization, although any change that affects the relative prices of the goods can be expected to stimulate similar dynamic effects. Trade liberalization, which in the extreme would be a movement from autarky to free trade, would raise the price of the country’s export good and lower the price of its import good. The change in prices sets off the following effects.</p>

    <div class="section" id="fwk-61960-ch05_s17_s02">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Short-Run Effects: Immobile Factor Model</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch05_s17_s02_p01">The immobile factor model, beginning in <a class="xref" href="fwk-61960-ch04#fwk-61960-ch04">Chapter 4 "Factor Mobility and Income Redistribution"</a>, <a class="xref" href="fwk-61960-ch04_s04#fwk-61960-ch04_s04">Section 4.4 "Immobile Factor Model Overview and Assumptions"</a>, was based on a variation of the Ricardian model. As such, the model assumed only one factor of production and different production technologies across countries. The results from that model do carry over into this two-factor, identical technology context, however.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch05_s17_s02_p02">First, consider the transition to the change in output prices. When the price of the export good rises, firms in the export industry will begin to collect more revenue from sales of their product. Initially, firm profit will begin to rise since the wage rate and rental rate on capital remains fixed. The increase in profit will stimulate the desire to expand production, but production cannot expand by drawing factors from the other industry due to the immobility of factors. Instead, profit-seeking firms within the industry will begin to compete for the capital and labor already in the industry. (Immobility of factors across industries does not mean that factors cannot move between firms within the industry. Recall also that the assumption of perfect competition implies that there are many, many firms operating within an industry.)</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch05_s17_s02_p03">Each export firm now has the incentive to lure workers and capital away from other export firms so that it can expand its own production and raise its share of the industry profit. However, the only way to entice factor mobility within the industry is to offer a higher wage and a higher rent. Some factors may now move to other firms, while others may simply negotiate a higher payment from their present employer to induce them to stay. This bidding war will raise both the wage rate and the rental rate to factors employed within the export industry. The bidding war will end once the total factor cost to each firm is equal to revenue and the profit is driven to zero.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch05_s17_s02_p04">In the import industry, firms now face a lower price and hence a lower revenue. Profits will become negative for all firms in the industry. The firms’ only options to cut their losses are to contract by laying off workers or to lower the payments to the workers and capital owners. We will assume, for simplicity, that full employment prevails. However, we could easily imagine the bargaining strategy of the firm managers with the workers: “Either we lower your wages or we eliminate your job.” Given that factors are assumed to be immobile across industries, there is no hope, at least in the short run, of finding another job. If you are laid off, you could find alternative employment in another firm, but it would only hire you at a lower wage. The assumption of full employment, then, really just means that the price system in the market responds to the excess supply of workers and capital in this industry by lowering factor prices until all the factors are fully employed. Therefore, wages and rents will fall in the import-competing industry until profit in the industry rises to zero and losses are eliminated.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch05_s17_s02_p05">Although it is more difficult to explain intuitively, the real returns to factors in the export industry will rise, while the real returns to factors in the import-competing industry will fall. This means that workers and capital owners in the export industry will have greater purchasing power after trade liberalization, while workers and capitalists in the import-competing industry will be able to buy less.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch05_s17_s02_p06">The final short-run effects are summarized in <a class="xref" href="#fwk-61960-ch05_s17_s02_f01">Figure 5.16 "Short-Run Factor Income Effects of Trade Liberalization"</a>. Both workers and capitalists affiliated with the export industry will benefit from trade liberalization, while workers and capitalists affiliated with the import-competing sector will lose from free trade. Note that income redistribution, at least initially, is based on industry affiliation. What determines who wins and who loses is the industry from which you receive your income.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Medium-Run Effects: The Specific Factor Model</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch05_s17_s03_p01">The SF model is based on a variation of the H-O model. It assumes that one factor, labor, is freely mobile between the two industries, while the second factor, capital, is completely immobile between industries. Although it is unlikely that one factor would move completely before another begins to adjust, the SF model nonetheless is an easily representable intermediate position between the short-run and long-run effects.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch05_s17_s03_p02">First, consider the transition to equilibrium in the SF model. After the final adjustment depicted in the immobile factor model, the wage rate paid to workers in the export industry is higher than the wage paid in the import-competing industry. In the next step of the transition, workers (assumed to be the more readily mobile factor) in the import-competing industry begin to seek ways to obtain a higher wage. This might require additional education or training, or it may require workers to move to another geographical area. In any case, the transition takes time. As workers begin to move across sectors, the supply of labor to the export industry will rise. Profit-seeking firms in that sector will realize that they can temporarily raise their profits by lowering their wage and hiring workers moving in from the other sector. Competition among export firms will eventually lower the wage of all workers in the export industry. Competition within the industry for the specific immobile capital will bid up the rental rate even further than in the short run.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch05_s17_s03_p03">At the same time, the workers fleeing the import-competing sector will reduce the supply of labor there. Import firms will bid among themselves for the remaining workers to maintain output and profit, which will raise the wage paid to workers in this sector. With declining output, the demand for capital will fall, causing an even further drop in the rental rate paid to capital owners.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch05_s17_s03_p04">When the final adjustment of labor across sectors is complete, the wage paid to workers in both industries will be equal. Capital remains in its original sector, but changing prices and outputs affect its sectoral demand. The rental rate paid to capital owners in the export industry will remain higher than that obtained before trade liberalization and will increase relative to the short run. The rental rate for capital owners in the import-competing sector will remain lower than that obtained before trade liberalization.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch05_s17_s03_p05">The magnification effect for prices in this model can be used to assess the real return to factors in the medium-run equilibrium relative to the returns prior to trade liberalization. It shows that the real return to capital owners in the export industry will rise with respect to purchases of both goods, while the real return to capital in the import industry will fall with respect to purchases of both goods. Thus, as shown in <a class="xref" href="#fwk-61960-ch05_s17_s03_f01">Figure 5.17 "Medium-Run Factor Income Effects of Trade Liberalization"</a>, capitalists in the export industry gain and capitalists in the import industry lose.</p>

        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch05_s17_s03_p06">The effect on workers is, in general, ambiguous. The real wage of workers in terms of purchases of the import good rises, while the real wage in terms of the export good falls. For this reason, we place a question mark in <a class="xref" href="#fwk-61960-ch05_s17_s03_f01">Figure 5.17 "Medium-Run Factor Income Effects of Trade Liberalization"</a> to note the ambiguity. Whether a worker benefits or loses depends, in part, on the worker’s preferences. If a worker has a high demand for the import good for which the real wage rises, then the worker may benefit. If, however, a worker has a relatively high demand for the export good, then the worker would lose.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="fwk-61960-ch05_s17_s04">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Long-Run Effects: The Heckscher-Ohlin Model</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch05_s17_s04_p01">The H-O model assumes that both factors, labor and capital, are freely mobile between the two industries. As such, this corresponds to a long-run outcome after factors fully adjust to the changes in prices.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch05_s17_s04_p02">After the final adjustment depicted in the SF model, the wage rate paid to workers is the same in both industries, but the rental rate on capital in the export industry is higher than the rental rate paid in the import-competing industry. In the next step of the transition, capital owners (assumed to adjust in the final stage) in the import-competing industry begin to seek ways to obtain higher rents. This might require adapting the capital equipment for use in the export sector or waiting for the capital to fully depreciate and then reinvesting in capital that is usable in the export sector. In any case, the transition takes time. As capital begins to move across sectors, the supply of capital in the export industry will rise. Profit-seeking firms in that sector will realize that they can temporarily raise their profits by lowering their rental and hiring capital moving in from the other sector. Capital owners already in the export sector will have to begin accepting a lower rental payment to avoid being laid off. After all, firm owners can argue that there is no need to keep paying the higher rental rates when there is now a flood of accessible capital streaming in from the import sector.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch05_s17_s04_p03">In the import-competing sector, the loss of capital to the export sector makes capital relatively scarcer in the import sector. This leads to competition among firms for the capital that remains and forces up the price of capital in the import industry. Capital will cease to move between the two industries when the price of capital is equal in both sectors.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch05_s17_s04_p04">As the capital adjusts between industries, outputs and wage rates also adjust. Because the expanding export industry is capital intensive, its demand of capital per worker is greater than the amount of capital per worker that the labor-intensive import industry is able to give up. This implies that the relative demand for capital is higher in the transition to the long-run equilibrium, which results in an increase in the equilibrium rental rate. However, the relative demand for workers in the transition is lower, and this causes a reduction in the equilibrium wage rate.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-surantrade-fn05_005">See J. P. Neary, “Short-Run Capital Specificity and the Pure Theory of International Trade,” <em class="emphasis">Economic Journal</em> 88, no. 351 (1978): 488–510, for an excellent description of the transition between the medium-run effects in the SF model and the long-run effects in the H-O model.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch05_s17_s04_p05">The magnification effect for prices in the H-O model reveals the real returns to the factors relative to those obtained prior to trade liberalization. The effect shows that the equilibrium rental rate rises by a greater percentage than the percentage changes in the two goods’ prices, indicating an absolute increase in the real rental rate for all capital owners. The effect also shows that the percentage change in the wage rate is less than the changes in both output prices, indicating an absolute reduction in the purchasing power of all workers’ wages. Since capital is the country’s relatively abundant factor vis-à-vis the rest of the world and labor is its relatively scarce factor, the general conclusion is that a country’s abundant factor gains from trade liberalization, while a country’s scarce factor loses. This result is indicated in <a class="xref" href="#fwk-61960-ch05_s17_s04_f01">Figure 5.18 "Long-Run Factor Income Effects of Trade Liberalization"</a>. Note that capital owners are shown to gain regardless of whether their capital is used in the expanding export sector or the declining import sector. Similarly, all workers lose, even those working in the expanding export sector.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch05_s17_s05_p01">Now let’s consider the dynamic impact of trade liberalization on factor returns. <a class="xref" href="#fwk-61960-ch05_s17_s05_f01">Figure 5.19 "Dynamic Export-Capital Income Effects of Trade Liberalization"</a>, <a class="xref" href="#fwk-61960-ch05_s17_s05_f02">Figure 5.20 "Dynamic Import-Capital Income Effects of Trade Liberalization"</a>, <a class="xref" href="#fwk-61960-ch05_s17_s05_f03">Figure 5.21 "Dynamic Export-Labor Income Effects of Trade Liberalization"</a>, and <a class="xref" href="#fwk-61960-ch05_s17_s05_f04">Figure 5.22 "Dynamic Import-Labor Income Effects of Trade Liberalization"</a> depict the changes in real income that might arise over time as a result of trade liberalization. We look at the following four factors in turn: (1) capital owners initially in the export industry, (2) capital owners initially in the import industry, (3) workers originally in the export industry, and (4) workers originally in the import industry. On the horizontal axis in <a class="xref" href="#fwk-61960-ch05_s17_s05_f01">Figure 5.19 "Dynamic Export-Capital Income Effects of Trade Liberalization"</a>, we plot time, with the initial time labeled TL to indicate when trade liberalization occurs. The equilibria that arise in the short run, medium run, and long run are depicted by the vertical blue dotted lines. On the vertical axis, we plot the change in real income, with zero representing the initial preliberalization level. When the graph is above zero, it indicates an increase in real income; when the graph is below zero, it represents a decrease in real income.</p>

        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch05_s17_s05_p02">First, consider the owners of capital in the export industry before trade liberalization occurs. The series of models suggests that they will gain in the short run, gain in the medium run, and gain in the long run. However, the transition stories suggest that initial short-run gains would be followed by an increase in these gains in the medium run, but owners would suffer a reduction in their gains in the long term. The dynamic path might look like the red line depicted in <a class="xref" href="#fwk-61960-ch05_s17_s05_f01">Figure 5.19 "Dynamic Export-Capital Income Effects of Trade Liberalization"</a>. Note that although the factor gains throughout the transition, the magnitude of its gains varies.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch05_s17_s05_p03">The models suggest that owners of capital initially in the import industry lose in the short run, will lose further in the medium run, but will ultimately gain in the long run. Its dynamic path might look like the red line in <a class="xref" href="#fwk-61960-ch05_s17_s05_f02">Figure 5.20 "Dynamic Import-Capital Income Effects of Trade Liberalization"</a>. Since this factor experiences both gains and losses, one way to evaluate whether these factor owners are indeed better off would be to calculate the present discounted value of this stream of costs and benefits. If the period of losses is sufficiently large or lasts long enough or if the discount rate is high and the person is myopic, the present value may be negative. Otherwise, the discounted value will be positive.</p>

If the short-run benefits are sufficiently large or last long enough or if the discount rate is high, then the present value would be positive. Otherwise, the present value is negative.</p>

Its dynamic time path may look like the red line in <a class="xref" href="#fwk-61960-ch05_s17_s05_f04">Figure 5.22 "Dynamic Import-Labor Income Effects of Trade Liberalization"</a>. We have set the medium-run effects to zero, but they conceivably could be positive or negative. The present value of this path is likely to be negative even if the factor experiences some medium-run gains.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch05_s17_s05_p06">In summary, the models suggest that the effects of trade liberalization on factor income are rather complex. Some factors will benefit in the short, medium, and long run. Some will lose in all periods. However, some factors will benefit in the short run and lose in the long run, while others will lose in the short run and gain in the long run. The determinants of these paths are whether income is from a relatively abundant factor or from a relatively scarce factor and which industry the factor is employed in before the liberalization occurs.</p>

                <li>Three models of trade can be interpreted as representing three time frames of factor adjustment to a new equilibrium.</li>
                <li>The immobile factor model represents a very short-run perspective. The specific factor model represents a medium-run perspective. The H-O model represents a long-run perspective.</li>
                <li>By piecing together the results of the models in a dynamic adjustment story, one can demonstrate greater complexity in the effects on factor incomes as time passes after an adjustment to free trade. Most factors will experience changing real income effects as the degree of factor mobility rises over time.</li>

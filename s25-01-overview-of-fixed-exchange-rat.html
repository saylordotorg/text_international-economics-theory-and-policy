            <li>Preview the discussion about fixed exchange rate systems, their varieties, and their mechanisms.</li>

    <p class="para editable block" id="suranfin-ch11_s01_p01">This chapter begins by defining several types of fixed exchange rate systems, including the gold standard, the reserve currency standard, and the gold exchange standard. The <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">price-specie flow mechanism</a><span class="glossdef">A description about how adjustments to shocks or changes are handled within a pure gold standard system.</span></span> is described for the gold standard. It continues with other modern fixed exchange variations such as fixing a currency to a basket of several other currencies, crawling pegs, fixing within a band or range of exchange rates, currency boards, and finally the most extreme way to fix a currency: adopting another country’s currency as your own, as is done with <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">dollarization</a><span class="glossdef">Currency fixing by adopting the U.S. dollar as one’s currency.</span></span> or euroization.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="suranfin-ch11_s01_p02">The chapter proceeds with the basic mechanics of a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">reserve currency standard</a><span class="glossdef">A currency standard in which all countries fix to one central reserve currency, while the reserve currency is not fixed to anything.</span></span> in which a country fixes its currency to another’s. In general, a country’s central bank must intervene in the foreign exchange (Forex) markets, buying foreign currency whenever there is excess supply (resulting in a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">balance of payments surplus</a><span class="glossdef">The balance on the balance of payments when the central bank sells domestic currency and buys foreign currency.</span></span>) and selling foreign currency whenever there is excess demand (resulting in a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">balance of payments deficit</a><span class="glossdef">The balance on the balance of payments when the central bank buys domestic currency and sells foreign reserves.</span></span>). These actions will achieve the fixed exchange rate version of the interest parity condition in which interest rates are equalized across countries. However, to make central bank actions possible, a country will need to hold a stock of foreign exchange reserves. If a country’s central bank does not intervene in the Forex in a fixed exchange system, black markets are shown to be a likely consequence.</p>

            <li>Adjustment under a gold standard involves the flow of gold between countries, resulting in equalization of prices satisfying purchasing power parity (PPP) and/or equalization of rates of return on assets satisfying interest rate parity (IRP) at the current fixed exchange rate.</li>
            <li>Reserve currency rules: (1) fix currency to another currency, known as the reserve currency; (2) central bank must hold a stock of foreign exchange reserves to facilitate Forex interventions.</li>
            <li>Gold-exchange standard rules: (1) reserve country fixes its currency to a weight of gold, (2) all other countries fix their currencies to the reserve, (3) reserve central bank freely exchanges gold for currency with other central banks, (4) nonreserve countries hold a stock of the reserve currency to facilitate intervention in the Forex.</li>
            <li>The post–World War II fixed exchange rate system, known as the Bretton Woods system, was a gold exchange standard.</li>
            <li>Some countries fix their currencies to a weighted average of several other currencies, called a “basket of currencies.”</li>
            <li>Some countries implement a crawling peg in which the fixed exchange rate is adjusted regularly.</li>
            <li>Some countries set a central exchange rate and allow free floating within a predefined range or band.</li>
            <li>Some countries implement currency boards to legally mandate Forex interventions.</li>
            <li>Some countries simply adopt another country’s currency, as with dollarization, or choose a brand-new currency, as with the euro.</li>
            <li>The interest rate parity condition becomes the equalization of interest rates between two countries in a fixed exchange rate system.</li>
            <li>A balance of payments surplus (deficit) arises when the central bank buys (sells) foreign reserves on the Forex in exchange for its own currency.</li>
            <li>A black market in currency trade arises when there is unsatisfied excess demand or supply of foreign currency in exchange for domestic currency on the Forex.</li>

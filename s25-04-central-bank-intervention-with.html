            <li>Learn what a central bank must do to maintain a credible fixed exchange rate in a reserve currency system.</li>
        </ol>
    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="suranfin-ch11_s04_p01">In a fixed exchange rate system, most of the transactions of one currency for another will take place in the private market among individuals, businesses, and international banks. However, by fixing the exchange rate the government would have declared illegal any transactions that do not occur at the announced rate. However, it is very unlikely that the announced fixed exchange rate will at all times equalize private demand for foreign currency with private supply. In a floating exchange rate system, the exchange rate adjusts to maintain the supply and demand balance. In a fixed exchange rate system, it becomes the responsibility of the central bank to maintain this balance.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="suranfin-ch11_s04_p02">The central bank can intervene in the private foreign exchange (Forex) market whenever needed by acting as a buyer and seller of currency of last resort. To see how this works, consider the following example.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="suranfin-ch11_s04_p03">Suppose the United States establishes a fixed exchange rate to the British pound at the rate <em class="emphasis">Ē</em><sub class="subscript">$/£</sub>. In <a class="xref" href="#suranfin-ch11_s04_f01">Figure 22.1 "Central Bank Intervention to Maintain a Fixed Exchange Rate"</a>, we depict an initial private market Forex equilibrium in which the supply of pounds (<em class="emphasis">S</em><sub class="subscript">£</sub>) equals demand (<em class="emphasis">D</em><sub class="subscript">£</sub>) at the fixed exchange rate (<em class="emphasis">Ē</em><sub class="subscript">$/£</sub>). But suppose, for some unspecified reason, the demand for pounds on the private Forex rises one day to <em class="emphasis">D</em>′<sub class="subscript">£</sub>.</p>

    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="suranfin-ch11_s04_p04">At the fixed exchange rate (<em class="emphasis">Ē</em><sub class="subscript">$/£</sub>), private market demand for pounds is now <em class="emphasis">Q</em><sub class="subscript">2</sub>, whereas supply of pounds is <em class="emphasis">Q</em><sub class="subscript">1</sub>. This means there is excess demand for pounds in exchange for U.S. dollars on the private Forex.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="suranfin-ch11_s04_p05">To maintain a credible fixed exchange rate, the U.S. central bank would immediately satisfy the excess demand by supplying additional pounds to the Forex market. That is, it sells pounds and buys dollars on the private Forex. This would cause a shift of the pound supply curve from <em class="emphasis">S</em><sub class="subscript">£</sub> to <em class="emphasis">S</em>′<sub class="subscript">£</sub>. In this way, the equilibrium exchange rate is automatically maintained at the fixed level.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="suranfin-ch11_s04_p06">Alternatively, consider <a class="xref" href="#suranfin-ch11_s04_f02">Figure 22.2 "Another Central Bank Intervention to Maintain a Fixed Exchange Rate"</a>, in which again the supply of pounds (<em class="emphasis">S</em><sub class="subscript">£</sub>) equals demand (<em class="emphasis">D</em><sub class="subscript">£</sub>) at the fixed exchange rate (<em class="emphasis">Ē</em><sub class="subscript">$/£</sub>). Now suppose, for some unspecified reason, the demand for pounds on the private Forex falls one day to <em class="emphasis">D</em>′<sub class="subscript">£</sub>. At the fixed exchange rate (<em class="emphasis">Ē</em><sub class="subscript">$/£</sub>), private market demand for pounds is now <em class="emphasis">Q</em><sub class="subscript">2</sub>, whereas supply of pounds is <em class="emphasis">Q</em><sub class="subscript">1</sub>. This means there is excess supply of pounds in exchange for U.S. dollars on the private Forex.</p>

    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="suranfin-ch11_s04_p07">In this case, an excess supply of pounds also means an excess demand for dollars in exchange for pounds. The U.S. central bank can satisfy the extra dollar demand by entering the Forex and selling dollars in exchange for pounds. This means it is supplying more dollars and demanding more pounds. This would cause a shift of the pound demand curve from <em class="emphasis">D</em>′<sub class="subscript">£</sub> back to <em class="emphasis">D</em><sub class="subscript">£</sub>. Since this intervention occurs immediately, the equilibrium exchange rate is automatically and always maintained at the fixed level.</p>

            <li>If, for example, the United States fixes its currency to the British pound (the reserve), when there is excess demand for pounds in exchange for U.S. dollars on the private Forex, the U.S. central bank would immediately satisfy the excess demand by supplying additional pounds to the Forex market. By doing so, it can maintain a credible fixed exchange rate.</li>

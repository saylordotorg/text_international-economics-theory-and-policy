    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch08_s07_p05">Consumers suffer a loss in surplus because the price they pay rises by the amount of the consumption tax. Producers experience no change in surplus since the producer price (i.e., the price received by producers) remains at the free trade level. Note that even though imports fall, this decrease has no positive effect on producers in this situation. Finally, the government receives tax revenue from the consumption tax. The revenue is calculated as the tax, <em class="emphasis">t</em> (given by <em class="emphasis">P</em><sub class="subscript"><em class="emphasis">C</em></sub> − <em class="emphasis">P</em><sub class="subscript"><em class="emphasis">P</em></sub>), multiplied by the quantity consumed, <em class="emphasis">D</em><sub class="subscript">2</sub>.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch08_s07_p06">Since the cost to consumers exceeds the benefits accruing to the government, the net national welfare effect of the consumption tax is negative. Although some segments of the population benefit, there remains a consumption efficiency loss, given by area <em class="emphasis">c</em>.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch08_s07_p07">In the rest of the world, the small country assumption implies that this domestic policy (the consumption tax) would have no noticeable effects. Foreign prices would remain unchanged, and although their exports to this country would fall, these changes in trade volumes are too small to be noticed in the rest of the world. Thus the welfare effects on the rest of the world are said to be nonexistent, or zero.</p>

            <li>A domestic consumption tax implemented in an import market by a small country will lower consumer surplus for domestic residents purchasing the product, increase government revenues and thereby benefit the recipients of subsequent government programs, and leave domestic producers of the product unaffected.</li>
            <li>A domestic consumption tax implemented in an import market by a small country will create a net consumption efficiency loss and reduce national welfare.</li>

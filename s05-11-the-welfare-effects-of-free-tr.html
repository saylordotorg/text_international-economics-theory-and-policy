    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch02_s11_p01">The second and more traditional method to evaluate the effects of free trade uses an aggregate welfare function to depict the overall welfare effects that would accrue to the nation. This method allows one to demonstrate the benefits that arise from increased production and consumption efficiency.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch02_s11_p02"><a class="xref" href="#fwk-61960-ch02_s11_f01">Figure 2.5 "Comparing Autarky and Free Trade Equilbriums"</a> compares autarky and free trade equilibriums for the United States and France. The U.S. PPF is given by the red line, while France’s PPF is given by the green line. We assume both countries share the same aggregate preferences represented by the indifference curves in the diagram. Note also that if the United States and France had the same size labor force, then the relative positions of the PPFs imply that the United States has the absolute advantage in cheese production, while France has the absolute advantage in wine production. Also, if each country has an absolute advantage in one of the two goods, then each country must also have the comparative advantage in that good.</p>

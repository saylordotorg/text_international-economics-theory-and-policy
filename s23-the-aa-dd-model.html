    <p class="para editable block" id="suranfin-ch09_p01">Ideally, it would be nice to develop a way to keep track of all the cause-and-effect relationships that are presumed to exist at the same time. From the previous chapters it is clear, for example, that the money supply affects the interest rates in the money market, which in turn affects the exchange rates in the foreign exchange (Forex) market, which in turn affects demand on the current account in the goods and services (G&amp;S) market, which in turn affects the level of GNP, which in turn affects the money market, and so on. The same type of string of repercussions can be expected after many other changes that might occur. Keeping track of these effects and establishing the final equilibrium values would be a difficult task if not for a construction like the AA-DD model. This model merges the money market, the Forex market, and the G&amp;S market into one supermodel. The construction of the AA-DD model is presented in this chapter.</p>

The AA-DD model represents a synthesis of the three previous market models: the foreign exchange (Forex) market, the money market, and the goods and services market. In a sense, there is really very little new information presented here. Instead, the chapter provides a graphical approach to integrate the results from the three models and to show their interconnectedness. However, because so much is going on simultaneously, working with the AA-DD model can be quite challenging.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="suranfin-ch09_s01_p02">The AA-DD model is described with a diagram consisting of two curves (or lines): an <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">AA curve</a><span class="glossdef">The set of exchange rate and GNP combinations that maintain equilibrium in the asset markets, which is given fixed values for all other exogenous variables.</span></span> representing asset market equilibriums derived from the money market and foreign exchange markets and a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">DD curve</a><span class="glossdef">The set of exchange rate and GNP combinations that maintain equilibrium in the goods and services market, which are given fixed values for all other exogenous variables.</span></span> representing goods market (or demand) equilibriums.

        <p class="para editable block" id="suranfin-ch09_s01_s02_p01">The AA-DD model will allow us to understand how changes in macroeconomic policy—both monetary and fiscal—can affect key aggregate economic variables when a country is open to international trade and financial flows while accounting for the interaction of the variables among themselves. Specifically, the model is used to identify potential effects of fiscal and monetary policy on exchange rates, trade balances, GDP levels, interest rates, and price levels both domestically and abroad. In subsequent chapters, analyses will be done under both floating and fixed exchange rate regimes.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="suranfin-ch09_s02_p01">The DD curve is derived by transferring information described in the goods and services (G&amp;S) market model onto a new diagram to show the relationship between the exchange rate and equilibrium gross national product (GNP). The original G&amp;S market, depicted in the top part of <a class="xref" href="#suranfin-ch09_s02_f01">Figure 20.1 "Derivation of the DD Curve"</a>, plots the aggregate demand (AD) function with respect to changes in U.S. GNP (<em class="emphasis">Y</em><sub class="subscript">$</sub>). Aggregate demand is measured along the vertical axis and aggregate supply (or the GNP) is measured on the horizontal axis. As discussed in <a class="xref" href="suranfin-ch08#suranfin-ch08">Chapter 19 "National Output Determination"</a>, <a class="xref" href="suranfin-ch08_s07#suranfin-ch08_s07">Section 19.7 "The Aggregate Demand Function"</a>, the AD function is dependent upon several different exogenous variables, most notably the exchange rate between domestic and foreign currency (<em class="emphasis">E</em><sub class="subscript">$/£</sub>). However, AD is also affected by investment demand (<em class="emphasis">I</em>), government demand (<em class="emphasis">G</em>), government tax revenues (<em class="emphasis">T</em>), government transfer payments (<em class="emphasis">TR</em>), and the price level in the domestic (<em class="emphasis">P</em><sub class="subscript">$</sub>) and foreign (<em class="emphasis">P</em><sub class="subscript">£</sub>) countries. The endogenous variable in the model is U.S. GNP (<em class="emphasis">Y</em><sub class="subscript">$</sub>). (See <a class="xref" href="#suranfin-ch09_s02_t01">Table 20.1 "G&amp;S Market"</a> for a quick reference.) In this exercise, since our focus is on the exchange rate, we label the AD function in <a class="xref" href="#suranfin-ch09_s02_f01">Figure 20.1 "Derivation of the DD Curve"</a> as <em class="emphasis">AD</em>(<em class="emphasis">E</em><sub class="subscript">$/£</sub>, …), where the ellipsis (…) is meant to indicate there are other unspecified variables that also influence AD.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="suranfin-ch09_s02_p02">Initially, let’s assume the exchange rate is at a value in the market given by <em class="emphasis">E</em><sub class="subscript">$/*</sub><sup class="superscript">1</sup>. We need to remember that all the other variables that affect AD are also at some initial level. Written explicitly, we could write AD as <em class="emphasis">AD</em>(<em class="emphasis">E</em><sub class="subscript">$/£</sub><sup class="superscript">1</sup>, <em class="emphasis">I</em><sup class="superscript">1</sup>, <em class="emphasis">G</em><sup class="superscript">1</sup>, <em class="emphasis">T</em><sup class="superscript">1</sup>, <em class="emphasis">TR</em><sup class="superscript">1</sup>, <em class="emphasis">P</em><sub class="subscript">$</sub><sup class="superscript">1</sup>, <em class="emphasis">P</em><sub class="subscript">£</sub><sup class="superscript">1</sup>). The AD function with exchange rate <em class="emphasis">E</em><sub class="subscript">$/£</sub><sup class="superscript">1</sup> intersects the forty-five-degree line at point <em class="emphasis">G</em> which determines the equilibrium level of GNP given by <em class="emphasis">Y</em><sub class="subscript">$</sub><sup class="superscript">1</sup>. These two values are transferred to the lower diagram at point <em class="emphasis">G</em> determining one point on the DD curve (<em class="emphasis">Y</em><sub class="subscript">$</sub><sup class="superscript">1</sup>, <em class="emphasis">E</em><sub class="subscript">$/£</sub><sup class="superscript">1</sup>).</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="suranfin-ch09_s02_p03">Next, suppose <em class="emphasis">E</em><sub class="subscript">$/£</sub> rises from <em class="emphasis">E</em><sub class="subscript">$/£</sub><sup class="superscript">1</sup> to <em class="emphasis">E</em><sub class="subscript">$/£</sub><sup class="superscript">2</sup>, ceteris paribus. This corresponds to a depreciation of the U.S. dollar with respect to the British pound. The ceteris paribus assumption means that investment, government, taxes, and so on stay fixed at levels <em class="emphasis">I</em><sup class="superscript">1</sup>, <em class="emphasis">G</em><sup class="superscript">1</sup>, <em class="emphasis">T</em><sup class="superscript">1</sup>, and so on. Since a dollar depreciation makes foreign G&amp;S relatively more expensive and domestic goods relatively cheaper, AD shifts up to <em class="emphasis">AD</em>(<em class="emphasis">E</em><sub class="subscript">$/£</sub><sup class="superscript">2</sup>, …). The equilibrium shifts to point <em class="emphasis">H</em> at a GNP level <em class="emphasis">Y</em><sub class="subscript">$</sub><sup class="superscript">2</sup>.

    <p class="para editable block" id="suranfin-ch09_s02_p04">The line drawn through points <em class="emphasis">G</em> and <em class="emphasis">H</em> on the lower diagram is called the DD curve. The DD curve plots an equilibrium GNP level for every possible exchange rate that may prevail, ceteris paribus. Stated differently, the DD curve is the combination of exchange rates and GNP levels that maintain equilibrium in the G&amp;S market, ceteris paribus. We can think of it as the set of aggregate demand equilibriums.</p>
    <div class="section" id="suranfin-ch09_s02_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">A Note about Equilibriums</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="suranfin-ch09_s02_s01_p01">An equilibrium in an economic model typically corresponds to a point toward which the endogenous variable values will converge based on some behavioral assumption about the participants in the model. In this case, equilibrium is not represented by a single point. Instead every point along the DD curve is an equilibrium value.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="suranfin-ch09_s02_s01_p02">If the economy were at a point above the DD curve, say, at <em class="emphasis">I</em> in the lower diagram, the exchange rate would be <em class="emphasis">E</em><sub class="subscript">$/£</sub><sup class="superscript">2</sup> and the GNP level at <em class="emphasis">Y</em><sub class="subscript">$</sub><sup class="superscript">1</sup>. This corresponds to point <em class="emphasis">I</em> in the upper diagram where <em class="emphasis">AD</em> &gt; <em class="emphasis">Y</em>, read off the vertical axis. In the G&amp;S model, whenever aggregate demand exceeds aggregate supply, producers respond by increasing supply, causing GNP to rise. This continues until <em class="emphasis">AD</em> = <em class="emphasis">Y</em> at point <em class="emphasis">H</em>. For all points to the left of the DD curve, <em class="emphasis">AD</em> &gt; <em class="emphasis">Y</em>, therefore the behavior of producers would cause a shift to the right from any point like <em class="emphasis">I</em> to a point like <em class="emphasis">H</em> on the DD curve.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="suranfin-ch09_s02_s01_p03">Similarly, at a point such as <em class="emphasis">J</em>, to the right of the DD curve, the exchange rate is <em class="emphasis">E</em><sub class="subscript">$/£</sub><sup class="superscript">1</sup> and the GNP level is at <em class="emphasis">Y</em><sub class="subscript">$</sub><sup class="superscript">2</sup>. This corresponds to point <em class="emphasis">J</em> in the upper diagram above where aggregate demand is less than supply (<em class="emphasis">AD</em> &lt; <em class="emphasis">Y</em>). In the G&amp;S model, whenever supply exceeds demand, producers respond by reducing supply, thus GNP falls. This continues until <em class="emphasis">AD</em> = <em class="emphasis">Y</em> at point <em class="emphasis">G</em>. For all points to the right of the DD curve, <em class="emphasis">AD</em> &lt; <em class="emphasis">Y</em>, therefore the behavior of producers would cause a shift to the left from any point like <em class="emphasis">J</em> to a point like <em class="emphasis">G</em> on the DD curve.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="suranfin-ch09_s02_s01_p04">A useful analogy is to think of the DD curve as a river flowing through a valley. (See the 3-D diagram in <a class="xref" href="#suranfin-ch09_s02_s01_f01">Figure 20.2 "A 3-D DD Curve"</a>.) The hills rise up to the right and left along the upward-sloping DD curve. Just as gravity will move a drop of water downhill onto the river valley, firm behavior will move GNP much in the same way: right or left to the lowest point along the DD curve.</p>

    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="suranfin-ch09_s04_p01">The AA curve is derived by transferring information described in the money market and foreign exchange market models onto a new diagram to show the relationship between the exchange rate and equilibrium GNP. (At this point we will substitute GNP for its virtually equivalent measure, GDP, as a determinant of real money demand.) Since both models describe supply and demand for money, which is an asset, I’ll refer to the two markets together as the asset market. The foreign exchange market, depicted in the top part of <a class="xref" href="#suranfin-ch09_s04_f01">Figure 20.4 "Derivation of the AA Curve"</a>, plots the rates of return on domestic U.S. assets (<em class="emphasis">RoR</em><sub class="subscript">$</sub>) and foreign British assets (<em class="emphasis">RoR</em><sub class="subscript">£</sub>). (See <a class="xref" href="suranfin-ch05#suranfin-ch05">Chapter 16 "Interest Rate Parity"</a>, <a class="xref" href="suranfin-ch05_s03#suranfin-ch05_s03">Section 16.3 "Forex Equilibrium with the Rate of Return Diagram"</a> for a complete description.)

The asset market equilibriums have several exogenous variables that determine the positions of the curves and the outcome of the model.

Since the increase in GNP raises real money demand, <em class="emphasis">L</em>(<em class="emphasis">i</em><sub class="subscript">$</sub>, <em class="emphasis">Y</em><sub class="subscript">$</sub>), it shifts out to <em class="emphasis">L</em>(<em class="emphasis">i</em><sub class="subscript">$</sub>, <em class="emphasis">Y</em><sub class="subscript">$</sub><sup class="superscript">2</sup>).

    <p class="para editable block" id="suranfin-ch09_s06_p01">The DD curve represents the set of equilibriums in the goods and services (G&amp;S) market. It describes an equilibrium gross national product (GNP) level for each and every exchange rate that may prevail. Due to the assumption that firms respond to excess demand by increasing supply (and to excess supply by decreasing supply), GNP rises or falls until the economy is in equilibrium on the DD curve.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="suranfin-ch09_s06_p02">The AA curve represents the set of equilibriums in the asset market. It indicates an equilibrium exchange rate for each and every GNP level that might prevail. Due to the assumption that investors will demand foreign currency when the foreign rate of return exceeds the domestic return and that they will supply foreign currency when the domestic rate of return exceeds the foreign return, the exchange rate will rise or fall until the economy is in equilibrium on the AA curve.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="suranfin-ch09_s06_p03">Since both the G&amp;S market and the asset markets are operating concurrently, equilibriums in both markets can only occur where the DD curve intersects the AA curve. This is shown in <a class="xref" href="#suranfin-ch09_s06_f01">Figure 20.7 "AA-DD Superequilibrium"</a> at point <em class="emphasis">F</em>, with equilibrium GNP (<em class="emphasis">_</em><sub class="subscript">$</sub>) and exchange rate (<em class="emphasis">Ê</em><sub class="subscript">$/£</sub>). It is worth emphasizing that at point <em class="emphasis">F</em>, the three markets—that is, the G&amp;S market, the money market, and the foreign exchange market—are in equilibrium simultaneously. For this reason, point <em class="emphasis">F</em> is more than a plain old equilibrium; instead it is a <em class="emphasis">superequilibrium</em>.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="suranfin-ch09_s06_p04">The superequilibrium point is where we would expect behavioral responses by firms, households, and investors to move the exchange rate and GNP level, assuming the exogenous variables remain fixed at their original levels and assuming sufficient time is allowed for adjustment to the equilibrium to take place.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="suranfin-ch09_s06_p05">The equilibrium at <em class="emphasis">F</em> is like the lowest point of two intersecting valleys that reach their combined lowest point at a pool where the two valleys meet. A 3-D rendition of this is shown in <a class="xref" href="#suranfin-ch09_s06_f02">Figure 20.8 "A 3-D AA-DD Depiction"</a>. The steepness of the valleys is meant to represent the speed of adjustment. Thus the AA valley is drawn much steeper than the DD valley to reflect the much more rapid adjustment in the asset markets in comparison to goods market adjustment. Anytime the economy is away from the equilibrium, forces will act to move it to the pool in the center. However, as will be shown later, adjustment to the AA curve will occur much faster than adjustment to the DD curve.</p>

        </ol>
    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="suranfin-ch09_s07_p01">In order to discuss adjustment to the superequilibrium, we must first talk about how an economy can end up out of equilibrium. This will occur anytime there is a change in one or more of the exogenous variables that cause the AA or DD curves to shift. In a real economy, we should expect these variables to be changing frequently. Variables such as interest rates will certainly change every day. A variable such as the average expected future exchange rate held by investors probably changes every minute. Each time an exogenous variable changes, the superequilibrium point will shift, setting off behavioral responses by households, businesses, and investors that will affect the exchange rate and gross national product (GNP) in the direction of the new superequilibrium. However, as we will indicate below, the adjustment process will take time, perhaps several months or more, depending on the size of the change. Since we should expect that as adjustment to one variable change is in process, other exogenous variables will also change, we must recognize that the superequilibrium is really like a moving target. Each day, maybe each hour, the target moves, resulting in a continual adjustment process.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="suranfin-ch09_s07_p02">Although an equilibrium may never be reached in the real-world economy, the model remains very useful in understanding how changes in some variables will affect the behavior of agents and influence other variables. The model in essence offers us the opportunity to conduct experiments in simplified settings. Changing one exogenous variable and inferring its effect is a comparative statics <em class="emphasis">experiment</em> because of the ceteris paribus assumption. Ceteris paribus allows us to isolate one change and work through its impact with certainty that nothing else could influence the result.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="suranfin-ch09_s07_p03">Below, we’ll consider adjustment to two changes: a reduction in investment demand, which shifts the DD curve, and an increase in foreign interest rates, which shifts the AA curve.</p>

        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="suranfin-ch09_s07_s01_p02">The quick result is that the equilibrium shifts to point <em class="emphasis">G</em>, GNP falls to <em class="emphasis">Y</em><sub class="subscript">$</sub><sup class="superscript">3</sup>, and the exchange rate rises to <em class="emphasis">E</em><sub class="subscript">$/£</sub><sup class="superscript">3</sup>. The increase in the exchange rate represents a depreciation of the U.S. dollar value. However, this result does not explain the adjustment process, so let’s take a more careful look at how the economy gets from point <em class="emphasis">F</em> to <em class="emphasis">G</em>.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="suranfin-ch09_s07_s01_p03"><strong class="emphasis bold">Step 1</strong>: When investment demand falls, aggregate demand falls short of aggregate supply, leading to a buildup of inventories. Firms respond by cutting back supply, and GNP slowly begins to fall. Initially, there is no change in the exchange rate. On the graph, this is represented by a leftward shift from the initial equilibrium at point <em class="emphasis">F</em> (<em class="emphasis">Y</em><sub class="subscript">$</sub><sup class="superscript">1</sup> to <em class="emphasis">Y</em><sub class="subscript">$</sub><sup class="superscript">2</sup>). Adjustment to changes in aggregate demand will be gradual, perhaps taking several months or more to be fully implemented.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="suranfin-ch09_s07_s01_p04"><strong class="emphasis bold">Step 2</strong>: As GNP falls, it causes a decrease in U.S. interest rates. With lower interest rates, the rate of return on U.S. assets falls below that in the United Kingdom and international investors shift funds abroad, leading to a dollar depreciation (pound appreciation)—that is, an increase in the exchange rate <em class="emphasis">E</em><sub class="subscript">$/£</sub>. This moves the economy upward, back to the AA curve. The adjustment in the asset market will occur quickly after the change in interest rates, so the leftward shift from point <em class="emphasis">F</em> in the diagram results in adjustment upward to regain equilibrium in the asset market on the AA curve.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="suranfin-ch09_s07_s01_p05"><strong class="emphasis bold">Step 3</strong>: Continuing reductions in GNP caused by excess aggregate demand, results in continuing decreases in interest rates and rates of return, repeating the stepwise process above until the new equilibrium is reached at point <em class="emphasis">G</em> in the diagram.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="suranfin-ch09_s07_s01_p06">During the adjustment process, there are several other noteworthy changes taking place. At the initial equilibrium, when investment demand first falls, aggregate supply exceeds demand by the difference of <em class="emphasis">Y</em><sub class="subscript">$</sub><sup class="superscript">2</sup> − <em class="emphasis">Y</em><sub class="subscript">$</sub><sup class="superscript"><em class="emphasis">A</em></sup>. Adjustment in the goods market will be trying to reachieve equilibrium by getting back to the DD curve. However, the economy will never get to <em class="emphasis">Y</em><sub class="subscript">$</sub><sup class="superscript"><em class="emphasis">A</em></sup>. That’s because the asset market will adjust in the meantime. As GNP falls, the exchange rate is pushed up to get back onto the AA curve. Remember, that asset market adjustment takes place quickly after an interest rate change (perhaps in several hours or days), while goods market adjustment can take months. When the exchange rate rises, the dollar depreciation makes foreign goods more expensive and reduces imports. It also makes U.S. goods cheaper to foreigners and stimulates exports, both of which cause an increase in current account demand. This change in demand is represented as a movement along the new <em class="emphasis">D</em>′<em class="emphasis">D</em>′ curve. Thus when the exchange rate rises up to <em class="emphasis">E</em><sub class="subscript">$/£</sub><sup class="superscript">2</sup> during the adjustment process, aggregate demand will have risen from <em class="emphasis">Y</em><sub class="subscript">$</sub><sup class="superscript"><em class="emphasis">A</em></sup> to <em class="emphasis">Y</em><sub class="subscript">$</sub><sup class="superscript"><em class="emphasis">B</em></sup> along the new <em class="emphasis">D</em>′<em class="emphasis">D</em>′ curve. In other words, the “target” for GNP adjustment moves closer as the exchange rate rises. In the end, the target for GNP reaches <em class="emphasis">Y</em><sub class="subscript">$</sub><sup class="superscript">3</sup> just as the exchange rate rises to <em class="emphasis">E</em><sub class="subscript">$/£</sub><sup class="superscript">3</sup>.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="suranfin-ch09_s07_s02_p02">The quick result is that the equilibrium shifts to point <em class="emphasis">H</em>, GNP rises to <em class="emphasis">Y</em><sup class="superscript">3</sup>, and the exchange rate rises to <em class="emphasis">E</em><sup class="superscript">3</sup>. The increase in the exchange rate represents a depreciation of the U.S. dollar value.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="suranfin-ch09_s07_s02_p03">The convenience of the graphical approach is that it allows us to quickly identify the final outcome using only our knowledge about the mechanics of the AA-DD diagram. However, this quick result does not explain the adjustment process, so let’s take a more careful look at how the economy gets from point <em class="emphasis">F</em> to <em class="emphasis">H</em>.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="suranfin-ch09_s07_s02_p04"><strong class="emphasis bold">Step 1</strong>: When the foreign interest rate (<em class="emphasis">i</em><sub class="subscript">£</sub>) rises, the rate of return on foreign British assets rises above the rate of return on domestic U.S. assets in the foreign exchange market. This causes an immediate increase in the demand for foreign British currency, causing an appreciation of the pound and a depreciation of the U.S. dollar. Thus the exchange rate (<em class="emphasis">E</em><sub class="subscript">$/£</sub>) rises. This change is represented by the movement from point <em class="emphasis">F</em> to <em class="emphasis">G</em> on the AA-DD diagram. The AA curve shifts up to reflect the new set of asset market equilibriums corresponding to the now-higher foreign interest rate. Since the foreign exchange market adjusts very swiftly to changes in interest rates, the economy will not remain off the new A′A′ curve for very long.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="suranfin-ch09_s07_s02_p05"><strong class="emphasis bold">Step 2</strong>: Now that the exchange rate has risen to <em class="emphasis">E</em><sub class="subscript">$/£</sub><sup class="superscript">2</sup>, the real exchange has also increased. This implies foreign goods and services are relatively more expensive while U.S. G&amp;S are relatively cheaper. This will raise demand for U.S. exports, curtail demand for U.S. imports, and result in an increase in current account and thereby aggregate demand. Note that the new equilibrium demand at exchange rate is temporarily at GNP level <em class="emphasis">Y</em><sup class="superscript">4</sup>, which is on the DD curve given the exchange rate <em class="emphasis">E</em><sub class="subscript">$/£</sub><sup class="superscript">2</sup>. Because aggregate demand exceeds aggregate supply, inventories will begin to fall, stimulating an increase in production and thus GNP. This is represented by a rightward shift from point <em class="emphasis">G</em> (small arrow).</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="suranfin-ch09_s07_s02_p06"><strong class="emphasis bold">Step 3</strong>: As GNP rises, so does real money demand, causing an increase in U.S. interest rates. With higher interest rates, the rate of return on U.S. assets rises above that in the United Kingdom and international investors shift funds back to the United States, leading to a dollar appreciation (pound depreciation), or the decrease in the exchange rate (<em class="emphasis">E</em><sub class="subscript">$/£</sub>). This moves the economy downward, back to the A′A′ curve. The adjustment in the asset market will occur quickly after the change in interest rates. Thus the rightward shift from point <em class="emphasis">G</em> in the diagram results in quick downward adjustment to regain equilibrium in the asset market on the A′A′ curve, as shown.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="suranfin-ch09_s07_s02_p07"><strong class="emphasis bold">Step 4</strong>: Continuing increases in GNP caused by excess aggregate demand, results in continuing increases in U.S. interest rates and rates of return, repeating the stepwise process above until the new equilibrium is reached at point <em class="emphasis">H</em> in the diagram.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="suranfin-ch09_s07_s02_p08">During the adjustment process, there are several other noteworthy changes taking place. At point <em class="emphasis">G</em>, aggregate demand exceeds supply by the difference <em class="emphasis">Y</em><sup class="superscript">4</sup> − <em class="emphasis">Y</em><sup class="superscript">1</sup>. Adjustment in the goods market will be trying to reachieve equilibrium by getting back to the DD curve. However, the economy will never get to <em class="emphasis">Y</em><sup class="superscript">4</sup>. That’s because the asset market will adjust during the transition. As GNP rises, the exchange rate is gradually pushed down to get back onto the A′A′ curve. When the exchange rate falls, the dollar appreciation makes foreign goods cheaper, raising imports. It also makes U.S. goods more expensive to foreigners, reducing exports—both of which cause a decrease in current account demand. This change in demand is represented as a movement along the DD curve. Thus when the exchange rate falls during the adjustment process, aggregate demand falls from <em class="emphasis">Y</em><sup class="superscript">4</sup> along the DD curve. In other words, the “target” for GNP adjustment moves closer as the exchange rate falls. In the end, the target for GNP reaches <em class="emphasis">Y</em><sup class="superscript">3</sup> just as the exchange rate falls to <em class="emphasis">E</em><sub class="subscript">$/£</sub><sup class="superscript">3</sup>.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="suranfin-ch09_s08_p01">In later chapters we will use the AA-DD model to describe the effects of policy changes on macroeconomic variables in an open economy. The two most important macro variables are the exchange rate and the current account (trade) balance. The effects of changes on the exchange rate are vividly portrayed in the AA-DD diagram since this variable is plotted along the vertical axis and its value is determined as an element of the equilibrium. The current account (CA) variable is not displayed in the AA-DD diagram, but with some further thought we can devise a method to identify the current account balance at different positions in the AA-DD diagram.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="suranfin-ch09_s08_p02">First, note that there is no “equilibrium” current account balance in a floating exchange rate system. Any balance on the current account is possible because any balance can correspond to balance on the balance of payments. The balance of payments is made up of two broad subaccounts: the current account and the financial account, the sum of whose balances must equal zero. When the balances sum to zero, the foreign demand for domestic goods, services, income, <em class="emphasis">and</em> assets is equal to domestic supply of goods, services, income, and assets. Thus there must always be “balance” on the balance of payments regardless of the balances on the individual subaccounts.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="suranfin-ch09_s08_s02_p01">Consider the superequilibrium point at the intersection of AA and DD. The positions of these two curves are determined by the values of the exogenous variables in the model, including the domestic price level (<em class="emphasis">P</em><sub class="subscript">$</sub>), the foreign price level (<em class="emphasis">P</em><sub class="subscript">£</sub>), tax revenues (<em class="emphasis">T</em>), and transfer payments (<em class="emphasis">TR</em>), among others. The intersection of the two curves determines the equilibrium GNP level (<em class="emphasis">Y</em><sub class="subscript">$</sub>) and the exchange rate (<em class="emphasis">E</em><sub class="subscript">$/£</sub>) (not labeled in diagram). Recall from <a class="xref" href="suranfin-ch09#suranfin-ch09">Chapter 20 "The AA-DD Model"</a>, <a class="xref" href="suranfin-ch09_s02#suranfin-ch09_s02">Section 20.2 "Derivation of the DD Curve"</a> that the DD curve is derived from the aggregate demand function, one component of which is the current account function. The current account function, as shown below, is a function of all the variables listed immediately above:</p>
        <span class="informalequation block"><math xml:id="suranfin-ch09_m001" display="block"> <semantics> <mrow> <mi>C</mi><msup><mi>A</mi><mi>D</mi></msup><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mover><mrow><mfrac><mrow><msub><mi>E</mi><mrow> <mtext>$/£</mtext> </mrow></msub><msub><mi>P</mi><mtext>£</mtext></msub></mrow><mrow><msub><mi>P</mi><mtext>$</mtext></msub></mrow></mfrac></mrow><mo>+</mo></mover><mo>,</mo><mover><mrow><mi>Y</mi><mo>−</mo><mi>T</mi><mo>+</mo><mi>T</mi><mi>R</mi></mrow><mo>−</mo></mover><mo stretchy="false">)</mo><mo>=</mo><mi>K</mi><mtext>.</mtext></mrow>  </semantics></math></span>
        <p class="para editable block" id="suranfin-ch09_s08_s02_p02">Thus at the intersection of AA and DD there are presumed known values for the exogenous variables and determined values for the endogenous variables, <em class="emphasis">E</em><sub class="subscript">$/£</sub> and <em class="emphasis">Y</em><sub class="subscript">$</sub>.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="suranfin-ch09_s08_s02_p03">All these values could, in principle, be plugged into the current account demand function (<em class="emphasis">CA</em><sup class="superscript"><em class="emphasis">D</em></sup>) to determine the CA balance at the equilibrium. Let’s assume that value is given by <em class="emphasis">K</em>, as shown in the above expression.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="suranfin-ch09_s08_s02_p04">Now let’s consider movements in the superequilibrium to other points on the diagram. Let’s suppose that the equilibrium moved to point <em class="emphasis">x</em> directly to the right. That could arise from a rightward shift of DD and an upward shift of AA. We will also assume that this shift did not arise due to changes in <em class="emphasis">P</em><sub class="subscript">$</sub>, <em class="emphasis">P</em><sub class="subscript">£</sub>, <em class="emphasis">T</em>, or <em class="emphasis">TR</em>, the other exogenous variables that affect the current account. (More on this issue below.) One possibility is an increase in the money supply and an increase in investment demand. Note that these shifts are not depicted.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="suranfin-ch09_s08_s02_p05">At point <em class="emphasis">x</em>, GNP is higher while the exchange rate and the other exogenous variables are the same as before. Since an increase in <em class="emphasis">Y</em><sub class="subscript">$</sub> raises disposable income, which reduces current account demand, the current account balance must be at a lower level at point <em class="emphasis">x</em> compared to the initial equilibrium.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="suranfin-ch09_s08_s02_p06">If the equilibrium had shifted to point <em class="emphasis">z</em> instead, then GNP is lower while the exchange rate and the other exogenous variables are the same as before. Since a decrease in <em class="emphasis">Y</em><sub class="subscript">$</sub> lowers disposable income, which raises current account demand, the current account balance must be at a higher level at point <em class="emphasis">z</em> compared to the initial equilibrium.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="suranfin-ch09_s08_s02_p07">Next, suppose the equilibrium had shifted to point <em class="emphasis">y</em> instead. In this case, the exchange rate (<em class="emphasis">E</em><sub class="subscript">$/£</sub>) is lower while GNP and the other exogenous variables are the same as before. Since a decrease in <em class="emphasis">E</em><sub class="subscript">$/£</sub> reduces the real exchange rate, which reduces current account demand, the current account balance must be at a lower level at point <em class="emphasis">y</em> compared to the initial equilibrium.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="suranfin-ch09_s08_s02_p08">Finally, suppose the equilibrium had shifted to point <em class="emphasis">w</em>. In this case, the exchange rate, <em class="emphasis">E</em><sub class="subscript">$/£</sub>, is higher while GNP and the other exogenous variables are the same as before. Since an increase in <em class="emphasis">E</em><sub class="subscript">$/£</sub> raises the real exchange rate, which increases current account demand, the current account balance must be at a higher level at point <em class="emphasis">y</em> compared to the initial equilibrium.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="suranfin-ch09_s08_s02_p09">Since a movement to <em class="emphasis">w</em> and <em class="emphasis">z</em> results in an increase in the current account balance, while a shift to <em class="emphasis">x</em> or <em class="emphasis">y</em> causes a reduction in the balance, the line representing a constant CAB must be positively sloped.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="suranfin-ch09_s08_s02_p10">Another way to see this is to use the <em class="emphasis">CA</em><sup class="superscript"><em class="emphasis">D</em></sup> function above. Suppose the CAB is originally at the value <em class="emphasis">K</em>. If the exchange rate (<em class="emphasis">E</em><sub class="subscript">$/£</sub>) rises, ceteris paribus, then CA will rise. We can now ask how GNP would have to change to get back to a CA balance of <em class="emphasis">K</em>. Clearly, if <em class="emphasis">Y</em> rises, disposable income rises and the current account balance falls. Raise GNP by precisely the right amount, and we can get the CAB back to <em class="emphasis">K</em>. Thus an increase in <em class="emphasis">E</em><sub class="subscript">$/£</sub> must accompany an increase in GNP to maintain a fixed current account balance and therefore an iso-CAB line must be positively sloped.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="suranfin-ch09_s08_s02_p11">The last thing we need to show is that the iso-CAB line is less steeply sloped than the DD line. Suppose the economy moved to a point such as <em class="emphasis">v</em>, which is on the same DD curve as the original superequilibrium. Recall from <a class="xref" href="suranfin-ch09#suranfin-ch09">Chapter 20 "The AA-DD Model"</a>, <a class="xref" href="suranfin-ch09_s02#suranfin-ch09_s02">Section 20.2 "Derivation of the DD Curve"</a>, the DD curve is derived from a change in the exchange rate and its effect on equilibrium GNP in the G&amp;S market alone. The increase in the exchange rate causes an increase in current account demand through its effect on the real exchange rate. This causes an increase in aggregate demand, which inspires the increase in GNP. When equilibrium is reached in the G&amp;S market, at point <em class="emphasis">v</em>, aggregate supply, <em class="emphasis">Y</em>, will equal aggregate demand and the following expression must hold:</p>
        <span class="informalequation block"><math xml:id="suranfin-ch09_m002" display="block"> <semantics><mrow><msub><mi>Y</mi><mtext>$</mtext></msub><mo>=</mo><msup><mi>C</mi><mi>D</mi></msup><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mover><mrow><msub><mi>Y</mi><mtext>$</mtext></msub><mo>−</mo><mi>T</mi><mo>+</mo><mi>T</mi><mi>R</mi></mrow><mo>+</mo></mover><mo stretchy="false">)</mo><mo>+</mo><msub><mi>I</mi><mn>0</mn></msub><mo>+</mo><msub><mi>G</mi><mn>0</mn></msub><mo>+</mo><mi>C</mi><msup><mi>A</mi><mi>D</mi></msup><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mover><mrow><mfrac><mrow><msub><mi>E</mi><mrow> <mtext>$/£</mtext> </mrow></msub><msub><mi>P</mi><mtext>£</mtext></msub></mrow><mrow><msub><mi>P</mi><mtext>$</mtext></msub></mrow></mfrac></mrow><mo>+</mo></mover><mo>,</mo><mover><mrow><msub><mi>Y</mi><mtext>$</mtext></msub><mo>−</mo><mi>T</mi><mo>+</mo><mi>T</mi><mi>R</mi></mrow><mo>−</mo></mover><mo stretchy="false">)</mo><mtext>.</mtext></mrow>  </semantics></math></span>
        <p class="para editable block" id="suranfin-ch09_s08_s02_p12">The left side is aggregate supply given by the equilibrium value at point <em class="emphasis">v</em> and the right side is aggregate demand. Since GNP is higher at v, consumption demand (<em class="emphasis">C</em><sup class="superscript"><em class="emphasis">D</em></sup>) must also be higher. However, because the marginal propensity to consume is less than one, not all the extra GNP will be spent on consumption goods; some will be saved. Nevertheless, aggregate demand (on the right side) must rise up to match the increase in supply on the left side. Since all the increase in demand cannot come from consumption, the remainder must come from the current account. This implies that a movement along the DD curve to <em class="emphasis">v</em> results in an increase in the current account balance. It also implies that the iso-CAB line must be less steeply sloped than the DD curve.</p>

    <div class="section" id="suranfin-ch09_s08_s03">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Using the Iso-CAB Line</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="suranfin-ch09_s08_s03_p01">The iso-CAB line can be used to assess the change in the country’s current account balance from any exogenous variable change except changes in <em class="emphasis">P</em><sub class="subscript">$</sub>, <em class="emphasis">P</em><sub class="subscript">£</sub>, <em class="emphasis">T</em>, and <em class="emphasis">TR</em>. The reason we must exclude these variables is because the current account demand function is also dependent on these exogenous variables. If tax revenues increased, for example, all the iso-CAB lines would shift, making it much more difficult to pinpoint the final effect on the current account balance.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="suranfin-ch09_s08_s03_p02">However, for monetary policy changes and government spending fiscal policy changes, the iso-CAB line will work. Anytime the superequilibrium shifts above the original iso-CAB line, the economy will move onto another iso-CAB line with a higher balance. (This is like the shift to point <em class="emphasis">v</em> in <a class="xref" href="#suranfin-ch09_s08_s01_f01">Figure 20.11 "Iso-CAB Lines in an AA-DD Diagram"</a>.) Recall that the <em class="emphasis">CA</em> = <em class="emphasis">EX</em> − <em class="emphasis">IM</em>, which can be positive or negative. If CAB were in surplus originally, an increase in the CAB (as with a movement to <em class="emphasis">v</em>) would imply an increase in the CA surplus. However, if the CAB were in deficit originally, then an increase in CAB implies a reduction in the deficit. If the increase in the CAB were sufficiently large, the CAB could move from deficit to surplus.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="suranfin-ch09_s08_s03_p03">In a similar way, anytime the superequilibrium shifts below an initial iso-CAB line, the CAB surplus will fall, or the CAB deficit will rise.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="suranfin-ch09_s08_s03_p04">Remember that the iso-CAB line is only used a reference to track the current account balance. The iso-CAB line is not used to determine the superequilibrium. For this reason, the iso-CAB line is plotted as a dashed line rather than a solid line.</p>

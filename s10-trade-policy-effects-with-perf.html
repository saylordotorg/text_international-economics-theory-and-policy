    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch07_p01">Governments have long intervened in international trade by collecting taxes, or tariffs, on imported goods. Tariffs have a long history since they are one of the easiest ways for governments to collect revenue. However, tariffs have a number of other effects besides generating government revenue; they also affect the success of business and the well-being of consumers. And because tariffs affect the volume of trade between countries, they also affect businesses and consumers abroad.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch07_p02">This chapter examines, in detail, the effects of a tariff. However, it also examines the impacts of the many other types of trade policies that governments have applied historically, including import quotas, export quotas, export taxes, and export subsidies.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch07_p03">The effects are considered under one set of standard assumptions—namely, in the case when markets are perfectly competitive.</p>

Supply and demand curves are used to depict the price effects of policies. Producer and consumer surplus is used to measure the welfare effects on participants in the market. A partial equilibrium analysis either ignores effects on other industries in the economy or assumes that the sector in question is very, very small and therefore has little if any impact on other sectors of the economy.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch07_s01_s01_p02">In contrast, a general equilibrium analysis incorporates the interaction of import and export sectors and then considers the effects of policies on multiple sectors in the economy. It uses offer curves to depict equilibria and measures welfare with aggregate welfare functions or trade indifference curves.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">The Large versus Small Country Assumption</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch07_s01_s02_p01">Two cases are considered regarding the size of the policy-setting country in international markets. The effects of policies vary significantly depending on the size of a country in international markets.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch07_s01_s02_p02">If the country is a “<span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">large country</a><span class="glossdef">A country is large if any change in its trade volume for a product is sufficiently large to affect the price of that product in the rest of the world.</span></span>” in international markets, then the country’s imports or exports are a significant share in the world market for the product. Whenever a country is large in an international market, domestic trade policies can affect the world price of the good. This occurs if the domestic trade policy affects supply or demand on the world market sufficiently to change the world price of the product.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch07_s01_s02_p03">If the country is a “<span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">small country</a><span class="glossdef">A country is small if any change in its trade volume for a product is too small to have any effect on the price of that product in the rest of the world.</span></span>” in international markets, then the policy-setting country has a very small share in the world market for the product—so small that domestic policies are unable to affect the world price of the good. The small country assumption is analogous to the assumption of perfect competition in a domestic goods market. Domestic firms and consumers must take international prices as given because they are too small for their actions to affect the price.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch07_s02_p03">The curves are drawn such that the U.S. autarky price is lower than the Mexican autarky price. This implies that if these two countries were to move from autarky to free trade, the United States would export wheat to Mexico. Once trade is opened, the higher Mexican price will induce profit-seeking U.S. firms to sell their wheat in Mexico, where it commands a higher price initially. As wheat flows into Mexico, the total supply of wheat rises, which will cause the price to fall. In the U.S. market, wheat supply falls because of U.S. exports. The reduced supply raises the equilibrium price in the United States. These prices move together as U.S. exports rise until the prices are equalized between the two markets. The free trade price of wheat, <em class="emphasis">P</em><sub class="subscript"><em class="emphasis">FT</em></sub>, is shared by both countries.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch07_s02_p04">To derive the free trade price and the quantity traded, we can construct an export supply curve for the United States and an import demand curve for Mexico. Notice that at prices above the autarky price in the United States, there is excess supply of wheat—that is, supply exceeds demand. If we consider prices either at or above the autarky price, we can derive an export supply curve for the United States. The equation for export supply is given by</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch07_s02_s02_p01">The small country assumption means that the country’s imports are a very small share of the world market—so small that even a complete elimination of imports would have an imperceptible effect on world demand for the product and thus would not affect the world price.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch07_s02_s02_p02">To depict a free trade equilibrium using an export supply and import demand diagram, we must redraw the export supply curve in light of the small country assumption. The assumption implies that the export supply curve is horizontal at the level of the world price. In this case, we call the importing country small. From the perspective of the small importing country, it takes the world price as exogenous since it can have no effect on it. From the exporter’s perspective, it is willing to supply as much of the product as the importer wants at the given world price.</p>

Willingness to pay can be read from a market demand curve for a product. The market demand curve shows the quantity of the good that would be demanded by all consumers at each and every price that might prevail.

    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch07_s04_p01">Suppose Mexico, the importing country in free trade, imposes a specific tariff on imports of wheat. As a tax on imports, the tariff will inhibit the flow of wheat across the border. It will now cost more to move the product from the United States into Mexico.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch07_s04_p02">As a result, the supply of wheat to the Mexican market will fall, inducing an increase in the price of wheat. Since wheat is homogeneous and the market is perfectly competitive, the price of all wheat sold in Mexico, both Mexican wheat and U.S. imports, will rise in price. The higher price will reduce Mexico’s import demand.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch07_s04_p03">The reduced wheat supply to Mexico will shift back supply to the U.S. market. Since Mexico is assumed to be a large importer, the supply shifted back to the U.S. market will be enough to induce a reduction in the U.S. price. The lower price will reduce the U.S. export supply.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch07_s04_p04">For this reason, a country that is a large importer is said to have <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">monopsony power in trade</a><span class="glossdef">Another term to describe a large importing country—that is, a country whose policy actions can affect international prices.</span></span>. A monopsony arises whenever there is a single buyer of a product. A monopsony can gain an advantage for itself by reducing its demand for a product in order to induce a reduction in the price. In a similar way, a country with monopsony power can reduce its demand for imports (by setting a tariff) to lower the price it pays for the imported product. Note that these price effects are identical in direction to the price effects of an import quota, a voluntary export restraint, and an export tax.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch07_s04_p05">A new tariff-ridden equilibrium will be reached when the following two conditions are satisfied:</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch07_s04_p08">The first condition represents a price wedge between the final U.S. price and the Mexican price equal to the amount of the tariff. The prices must differ by the tariff because U.S. suppliers of wheat must receive the same price for their product regardless of whether the product is sold in the United States or Mexico, and all wheat sold in Mexico must be sold at the same price. Since a tax is collected at the border, the only way for these price equalities within countries to arise is if the price differs across countries by the amount of the tax.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch07_s04_p09">The second condition states that the amount the United States wants to export at its new lower price must be equal to the amount Mexico wants to import at its new higher price. This condition guarantees that world supply of wheat equals world demand for wheat.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">The Price Effects of a Tariff: A Simple Dynamic Story</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch07_s04_s01_p01">For an intuitive explanation about why these price changes would likely occur in a real-world setting, read the following story about the likely dynamic adjustment process. Technically, this story is <em class="emphasis">not</em> a part of the partial equilibrium model, which is a static model that does not contain adjustment dynamics. However, it is worthwhile to think about how a real market adjusts to the equilibria described in these simple models.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch07_s04_s01_p02">Suppose the United States and Mexico are initially in a free trade equilibrium. Mexico imports wheat at the free trade price of $10 per bushel. Imagine that the market for unprocessed wheat in both the United States and Mexico is located in a warehouse in each country. Each morning, wheat arrives from the suppliers and is placed in the warehouse for sale. During the day, consumers of unprocessed wheat arrive to buy the supply. For simplicity, assume there is no service charge collected by the intermediary that runs the warehouses. Thus, for each bushel sold, $10 passes from the consumer directly to the producer.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch07_s04_s01_p03">Each day, the wheat market clears in the United States and Mexico at the price of $10. This means that the quantity of wheat supplied at the beginning of the day is equal to the quantity purchased by consumers during the day. Supply equals demand in each market at the free trade price of $10.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch07_s04_s01_p04">Now suppose that Mexico places a $2 specific tariff on imports of wheat. Let’s assume that the agents in the model react slowly and rather naively to the change. Let’s also suppose that the $2 tariff is a complete surprise.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch07_s04_s01_p05">Each day, prior to the tariff, trucks carrying U.S. wheat would cross the Mexican border in the wee hours, unencumbered, en route to the Mexican wheat market. On the day the tariff is imposed, the trucks are stopped and inspected. The drivers are informed that they must pay $2 for each bushel that crosses into Mexico.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch07_s04_s01_p06">Suppose the U.S. exporters of wheat naively pay the tax and ship the same number of bushels to the Mexican market that day. However, to recoup their losses, they raise the price by the full $2. The wheat for sale in Mexico now is separated into two groups. The imported U.S. wheat now has a price tag of $12, while the Mexican-supplied wheat retains the $10 price. Mexican consumers now face a choice. However, since Mexican and U.S. wheat are homogeneous, the choice is simple. Every Mexican consumer will want to purchase the Mexican wheat at $10. No one will want the U.S. wheat. Of course, sometime during the day, Mexican wheat will run out and consumers will either have to buy the more expensive wheat or wait till the next day. Thus some $12 U.S. wheat will sell, but not the full amount supplied. At the end of the day, a surplus will remain. This means that there will be an excess demand for Mexican wheat and an excess supply of U.S. wheat in the Mexican market.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch07_s04_s01_p07">Mexican producers of wheat will quickly realize that they can supply more to the market and raise their price. A higher price is possible because the competition is now charging $12. The higher supply and higher price will raise the profitability of the domestic wheat producers. (Note that the supply of wheat may not rise quickly since it is grown over an annual cycle. However, the supply of a different type of good could be raised rapidly. The length of this adjustment will depend on the nature of the product.) U.S. exporters will quickly realize that no one wants to buy their wheat at a price of $12. Their response will be to reduce export supply and lower their price in the Mexican market.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch07_s04_s01_p08">As time passes, in the Mexican market, the price of Mexican-supplied wheat will rise from $10 and the price of U.S. supplied wheat will fall from $12 until the two prices meet somewhere in between. The homogeneity of the goods requires that if both goods are to be sold in the Mexican market, then they must sell at the same price in equilibrium.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch07_s04_s01_p09">As these changes take place in the Mexican market, other changes occur in the U.S. market. When U.S. exporters of wheat begin to sell less in Mexico, that excess supply is shifted back to the U.S. market. The warehouse in the United States begins to fill up with more wheat than U.S. consumers are willing to buy at the initial price of $10. Thus at the end of each day, wheat supplies remain unsold. An inventory begins to pile up. Producers realize that the only way to unload the excess wheat is to cut the price. Thus the price falls in the U.S. market. At lower prices, though, U.S. producers are willing to supply less, thus production is cut back as well.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch07_s04_s01_p10">In the end, the U.S. price falls and the Mexican price rises until the two prices differ by $2, the amount of the tariff. A Mexican price of $11.50 and a U.S. price of $9.50 is one possibility. A Mexican price of $11 and a U.S. price of $9 is another. U.S. producers now receive the same lower price for wheat whether they sell in the United States or Mexico. The exported wheat is sold at the higher Mexican price, but $2 per bushel is paid to the Mexican government as tariff revenue. Thus U.S. exporters receive the U.S. price for the wheat sold in Mexico.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch07_s04_s01_p11">The higher price in Mexico raises domestic supply and reduces domestic demand, thus reducing their demand for imports. The lower price in the United States reduces U.S. supply, raises U.S. demand, and thus lowers U.S. export supply to Mexico. In a two-country world, the $2 price differential that arises must be such that U.S. export supply equals Mexican import demand.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Noteworthy Price Effects of a Tariff</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch07_s04_s02_p01">Two of the effects of a tariff are worthy of emphasis. First, although a tariff represents a tax placed solely on imported goods, the domestic price of both imported and domestically produced goods will rise. In other words, a tariff will cause local producers of the product to raise their prices. Why?</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch07_s04_s02_p02">In the model, it is assumed that domestic goods are perfectly substitutable for imported goods (i.e., the goods are homogeneous). When the price of imported goods rises due to the tariff, consumers will shift their demand from foreign to domestic suppliers. The extra demand will allow domestic producers an opportunity to raise output and prices to clear the market. In so doing, they will also raise their profit. Thus as long as domestic goods are substitutable for imports and as long as the domestic firms are profit seekers, the price of the domestically produced goods will rise along with the import price.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch07_s04_s02_p03">The average consumer may not recognize this rather obvious point. For example, suppose the United States places a tariff on imported automobiles. Consumers of U.S.-made automobiles may fail to realize that they are likely to be affected. After all, they might reason, the tax is placed only on imported automobiles. Surely this would raise the imports’ prices and hurt consumers of foreign cars, but why would that affect the price of U.S. cars? The reason, of course, is that the import car market and the domestic car market are interconnected. Indeed, the only way U.S.-made car prices would not be affected by the tariff is if consumers were completely unwilling to substitute U.S. cars for imported cars <em class="emphasis">or</em> if U.S. automakers were unwilling to take advantage of a profit-raising possibility. These conditions are probably unlikely in most markets around the world.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch07_s04_s02_p04">The second interesting price effect arises because the importing country is large. When a large importing country places a tariff on an imported product, it will cause <em class="emphasis">the foreign price to fall</em>. The reason? The tariff will reduce imports into the domestic country, and since its imports represent a sizeable proportion of the world market, world demand for the product will fall. The reduction in demand will force profit-seeking firms in the rest of the world to lower output and price in order to clear the market.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch07_s04_s02_p05">The effect on the foreign price is sometimes called the terms of trade effect. The terms of trade is sometimes defined as the price of a country’s <em class="emphasis">export goods</em> divided by the price of its <em class="emphasis">import goods</em>. Here, since the importing country’s import good will fall in price, the country’s terms of trade will rise. Thus a tariff implemented by a large country will cause an improvement in the country’s terms of trade.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch07_s05_p05"><em class="emphasis">Tariff effects on the importing country’s consumers</em>. Consumers of the product in the importing country suffer a reduction in well-being as a result of the tariff. The increase in the domestic price of both imported goods and the domestic substitutes reduces the amount of consumer surplus in the market.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch07_s05_p06"><em class="emphasis">Tariff effects on the importing country’s producers</em>. Producers in the importing country experience an increase in well-being as a result of the tariff. The increase in the price of their product on the domestic market increases producer surplus in the industry. The price increases also induce an increase in the output of existing firms (and perhaps the addition of new firms); an increase in employment; and an increase in profit, payments, or both to fixed costs.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch07_s05_p07"><em class="emphasis">Tariff effects on the importing country’s government</em>. The government receives tariff revenue as a result of the tariff. Who benefits from the revenue depends on how the government spends it. Typically, the revenue is simply included as part of the general funds collected by the government from various sources. In this case, it is impossible to identify precisely who benefits. However, these funds help support many government spending programs, which presumably help either most people in the country, as is the case with public goods, or certain worthy groups. Thus someone within the country is the likely recipient of these benefits.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch07_s05_p08"><em class="emphasis">Tariff effects on the importing country</em>. The aggregate welfare effect for the country is found by summing the gains and losses to consumers, producers, and the government. The net effect consists of three components: a positive terms of trade effect (<em class="emphasis">G</em>), a negative production distortion (<em class="emphasis">B</em>), and a negative consumption distortion (<em class="emphasis">D</em>).</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch07_s05_p09">Because there are both positive and negative elements, the net national welfare effect can be either positive or negative. The interesting result, however, is that it can be <em class="emphasis">positive</em>. This means that a tariff implemented by a large importing country <em class="emphasis">may</em> raise national welfare.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch07_s05_p10">Generally speaking, the following are true:</p>
    <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch07_s05_l02">
        <li>Whenever a large country implements a small tariff, it will raise national welfare.</li>
        <li>If the tariff is set too high, national welfare will fall.</li>
        <li>There will be a positive optimal tariff that will maximize national welfare.</li>
    </ol>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch07_s05_p11">However, it is also important to note that not everyone’s welfare rises when there is an increase in national welfare. Instead, there is a redistribution of income. Producers of the product and recipients of government spending will benefit, but consumers will lose. A national welfare increase, then, means that the sum of the gains exceeds the sum of the losses across all individuals in the economy. Economists generally argue that, in this case, compensation from winners to losers can potentially alleviate the redistribution problem.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch07_s05_p12"><em class="emphasis">Tariff effects on the exporting country’s consumers</em>. Consumers of the product in the exporting country experience an increase in well-being as a result of the tariff. The decrease in their domestic price raises the amount of consumer surplus in the market.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch07_s05_p13"><em class="emphasis">Tariff effects on the exporting country’s producers</em>. Producers in the exporting country experience a decrease in well-being as a result of the tariff. The decrease in the price of their product in their own market decreases producer surplus in the industry. The price decline also induces a decrease in output, a decrease in employment, and a decrease in profit, payments, or both to fixed costs.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch07_s05_p14"><em class="emphasis">Tariff effects on the exporting country’s government</em>. There is no effect on the exporting country’s government revenue as a result of the importer’s tariff.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch07_s05_p15"><em class="emphasis">Tariff effects on the exporting country</em>. The aggregate welfare effect for the country is found by summing the gains and losses to consumers and producers. The net effect consists of three components: a negative terms of trade effect (<em class="emphasis">g</em>), a negative consumption distortion (<em class="emphasis">f</em>), and a negative production distortion (<em class="emphasis">h</em>).</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch07_s05_p16">Since all three components are negative, the importer’s tariff must result in a reduction in national welfare for the exporting country. However, it is important to note that a redistribution of income occurs—that is, some groups gain while others lose. In this case, the sum of the losses exceeds the sum of the gains.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch07_s05_p17"><em class="emphasis">Tariff effects on world welfare</em>. The effect on world welfare is found by summing the national welfare effects on the importing and exporting countries. By noting that the terms of trade gain to the importer is equal to the terms of trade loss to the exporter, the world welfare effect reduces to four components: the importer’s negative production distortion (<em class="emphasis">B</em>), the importer’s negative consumption distortion (<em class="emphasis">D</em>), the exporter’s negative consumption distortion (<em class="emphasis">f</em>), and the exporter’s negative production distortion (<em class="emphasis">h</em>). Since each of these is negative, the world welfare effect of the import tariff is negative. The sum of the losses in the world exceeds the sum of the gains. In other words, we can say that an import tariff results in a reduction in world production and consumption efficiency.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch07_s06_p01">The possibility that a tariff could improve national welfare for a large country in international markets was first noted by Robert Torrens. Since the welfare improvement occurs only if the terms of trade gain exceeds the total deadweight losses, the argument is commonly known as the <em class="emphasis">terms of trade argument</em> for protection.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch07_s06_p02">Economists have studied the conditions under which a tariff will improve welfare in a variety of perfectly competitive models. This section describes the general results that come from that analysis.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch07_s06_p03">Consider <a class="xref" href="#fwk-61960-ch07_s06_f01">Figure 7.15 "Derivation of the Optimal Tariff: Large Country"</a>, which plots the levels of consumer surplus (<em class="emphasis">CS</em>), producer surplus (<em class="emphasis">PS</em>), and tariff revenue (<em class="emphasis">TR</em>) at different tariff rates. The origin corresponds to a zero tariff rate, or free trade. As the tariff is increased from zero, consumer surplus falls since the domestic price rises. This is shown by the solid declining (green) <em class="emphasis">CS</em> line. When the tariff becomes prohibitive at <em class="emphasis">t</em><sub class="subscript"><em class="emphasis">p</em></sub>, the price settles at the autarky price, and any further increases in the tariff have no effect on consumer surplus. Hence the <em class="emphasis">CS</em> line becomes flat above <em class="emphasis">t</em><sub class="subscript"><em class="emphasis">p</em></sub>.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch07_s06_p04">Producer surplus (<em class="emphasis">PS</em>), the red dotted line, rises as the tariff is increased from zero; however, it rises at a lower rate than consumer surplus falls. This occurs because, for an importing country, producer surplus increases are less than the change in consumer surplus for any increase in the tariff. When the prohibitive tariff is reached, again the price settles at the autarky price, and any further increases in the tariff rate have no effect on producer surplus.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch07_s06_p05">Tariff revenue (<em class="emphasis">TR</em>), the blue dashed line, first increases with the increase in the tariff and then decreases for higher tariff rates. This occurs because tariff revenue equals the tariff rate multiplied by imports. As the tariff is increased from zero, imports fall at a slower rate than the increase in the tariff rate, hence revenue rises. Eventually, imports begin to fall faster than the tariff rate rises, and tariff revenue declines. The tariff rate that generates the highest tariff revenue is called the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">maximum revenue tariff</a><span class="glossdef">The tariff that achieves the highest government revenue.</span></span>.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch07_s06_p06">Another way to see that tariff revenue must rise and then fall with increasing tariffs is to note that when the tariff rate is zero, tariff revenue has to be zero for any level of imports. Also, when the tariff rate is at or above <em class="emphasis">t</em><sub class="subscript"><em class="emphasis">p</em></sub>, the prohibitive tariff, imports are zero, thus whatever the tariff rate, tariff revenue again must be zero. Somewhere between a zero tariff and the prohibitive tariff, tariff revenue has to be positive. Thus tariff revenue must rise from zero and then fall back to zero when it reaches <em class="emphasis">t</em><sub class="subscript"><em class="emphasis">p</em></sub>.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch07_s06_p07">The national welfare level at each tariff rate is defined as the sum of consumer surplus, producer surplus, and tariff revenue. The vertical summation of these three curves generates the national welfare (<em class="emphasis">NW</em>) curve given by the thick, solid blue-green line. In <a class="xref" href="#fwk-61960-ch07_s06_f01">Figure 7.15 "Derivation of the Optimal Tariff: Large Country"</a>, the vertical summation is displayed for five different levels of the tariff rate.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch07_s06_p08">The basic shape of the national welfare line is redrawn in <a class="xref" href="#fwk-61960-ch07_s06_f02">Figure 7.16 "Optimal Tariff: Large Country Case"</a>. Note that national welfare first rises and then falls as the tariff is increased from zero. For one tariff rate (<em class="emphasis">t</em><sub class="subscript"><em class="emphasis">opt</em></sub>), the country can realize the highest level of national welfare (<em class="emphasis">NW</em><sub class="subscript"><em class="emphasis">opt</em></sub>), one that is higher than that achievable in free trade. We call that tariff rate the “optimal tariff.” One regularity that results is that the optimal tariff is always less than the maximum revenue tariff.</p>

    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch07_s06_p09">If the tariff is raised above the optimal rate, as with an increase from <em class="emphasis">t</em><sub class="subscript"><em class="emphasis">opt</em></sub> to <em class="emphasis">t</em><sub class="subscript"><em class="emphasis">B</em></sub>, then national welfare will fall. The terms of trade gain, which rises as low tariffs are increased, will begin to fall at a higher tariff rate. Since the deadweight losses continue to rise, both effects contribute to the decline in national welfare. Note, however, that at a tariff level like <em class="emphasis">t</em><sub class="subscript"><em class="emphasis">B</em></sub>, national welfare still exceeds the free trade level.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch07_s06_p10">Eventually, at even higher tariff rates, national welfare will fall below the free trade level. In <a class="xref" href="#fwk-61960-ch07_s06_f02">Figure 7.16 "Optimal Tariff: Large Country Case"</a>, this occurs at tariff rates greater than <em class="emphasis">t</em><sub class="subscript"><em class="emphasis">C</em></sub>. The higher the tariff is raised, the lower will be the level of imports. At a sufficiently high tariff, imports will be eliminated entirely. The tariff will prohibit trade. At the prohibitive tariff (<em class="emphasis">t</em><sub class="subscript"><em class="emphasis">p</em></sub>), there is no tariff revenue, which implies that the previously positive terms of trade gain is now zero. The only effect of the tariff is the deadweight loss. The economy is effectively in autarky, at least with respect to this one market, hence national welfare is at <em class="emphasis">NW</em><sub class="subscript"><em class="emphasis">Aut</em></sub>. Note that any additional increases in the tariff above <em class="emphasis">t</em><sub class="subscript"><em class="emphasis">p</em></sub> will maintain national welfare at <em class="emphasis">NW</em><sub class="subscript"><em class="emphasis">Aut</em></sub> since the market remains at the autarky equilibrium.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch07_s06_s01_p01">Trade liberalization can be represented by a decrease in the tariff rate on imports into a country. If the country is large in international markets, then the analysis in this chapter suggests that the effect on national welfare will depend on the values of the original tariff rate and the liberalized tariff rate.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch07_s06_s01_p02">For example, if the tariff is reduced from <em class="emphasis">t</em><sub class="subscript"><em class="emphasis">opt</em></sub> to <em class="emphasis">t</em><sub class="subscript"><em class="emphasis">A</em></sub>, then national welfare will fall when the country liberalizes trade in this market. However, if the tariff is reduced from <em class="emphasis">t</em><sub class="subscript"><em class="emphasis">B</em></sub> to <em class="emphasis">t</em><sub class="subscript"><em class="emphasis">opt</em></sub>, then national welfare will rise when trade liberalization occurs.

Consumers of the product in the importing country are worse off as a result of the tariff. The increase in the domestic price of both imported goods and the domestic substitutes reduces consumer surplus in the market.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch07_s08_p06"><em class="emphasis">Tariff effects on the importing country’s producers</em>. Producers in the importing country are better off as a result of the tariff. The increase in the price of their product increases producer surplus in the industry. The price increases also induce an increase in the output of existing firms (and perhaps the addition of new firms), an increase in employment, and an increase in profit, payments, or both to fixed costs.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch07_s08_p07"><em class="emphasis">Tariff effects on the importing country’s government</em>. The government receives tariff revenue as a result of the tariff. Who will benefit from the revenue depends on how the government spends it. These funds help support diverse government spending programs; therefore, someone within the country will be the likely recipient of these benefits.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch07_s08_p08"><em class="emphasis">Tariff effects on the importing country</em>. The aggregate welfare effect for the country is found by summing the gains and losses to consumers, producers, and the government. The net effect consists of two components: a negative production efficiency loss (<em class="emphasis">B</em>) and a negative consumption efficiency loss (<em class="emphasis">D</em>). The two losses together are typically referred to as “deadweight losses.”</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch07_s08_p09">Because there are only negative elements in the national welfare change, the net national welfare effect of a tariff must be negative.

        <li>The higher the tariff is set, the larger will be the loss in national welfare.</li>
        <li>The tariff causes a redistribution of income. Producers and the recipients of government spending gain, while consumers lose.</li>
        <li>Because the country is assumed to be small, the tariff has no effect on the price in the rest of the world; therefore, there are no welfare changes for producers or consumers there. Even though imports are reduced, the related reduction in exports by the rest of the world is assumed to be too small to have a noticeable impact.</li>

    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch07_s09_p01">The analysis of tariffs in a perfectly competitive market demonstrates that if a large country imposes a relatively small tariff, or if it imposes an optimal tariff, then domestic national welfare will rise but foreign national welfare will fall. The partial equilibrium analysis shows further that national welfare losses to the exporting nation exceed the national welfare gains to the importing nation. The reason is that any tariff set by a large country also reduces world welfare.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch07_s09_p02">If we assume that nations are concerned about the national welfare effects of trade policies, then the tariff analysis provides a rationale for protectionism on the part of large importing nations. However, if large importing nations set optimal tariffs on all or many of their imported goods, the effect internationally will be to reduce the national welfare of its trading partners. If the trade partners are also concerned about their own national welfare, then they would likely find the optimal tariffs objectionable and would look for ways to mitigate the negative effects.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch07_s09_p03">One effective way to mitigate the loss in national welfare, if the trade partners are also large countries, is to retaliate with optimal tariffs on your own imported goods. Thus if country A imports wine, cheese, and wheat from country B, and A places optimal tariffs on imports of these products, then country B could retaliate by imposing optimal tariffs on its imports of, say, lumber, televisions, and machine tools from country A. By doing so, country B could offset its national welfare losses in one set of markets with national welfare gains in another set.</p>

    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch07_s09_p04">We examine the effects of optimal tariffs and retaliation more formally by using a simple game theory setup. Suppose the players in the game are the governments of two large countries, the United States and Brazil. Suppose the United States imports a set of products (<em class="emphasis">A, B, C</em>, etc.) from Brazil, while Brazil imports a different set of products (<em class="emphasis">X, Y, Z</em>, etc.) from the United States. We imagine that each country’s government must choose between two distinct trade policies, free trade and optimal tariffs. Each policy choice represents a game strategy. If the United States chooses free trade, then it imposes no tariffs on imports of goods <em class="emphasis">A</em>, <em class="emphasis">B</em>, <em class="emphasis">C</em>, and so on. If the United States chooses optimal tariffs, then it determines the optimal tariff in each import market and sets the tariff accordingly. Brazil is assumed to have the same set of policy choices available.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch07_s09_p05">In <a class="xref" href="#fwk-61960-ch07_s09_f01">Figure 7.20 "A Trade Policy Game"</a>, U.S. strategies are represented by the two columns; Brazilian strategies correspond to the two rows. The numbers represent the payoffs to the countries, measured as the level of national welfare realized in each country in each of the four possible scenarios. For example, if the United States chooses a free trade policy and Brazil chooses to impose optimal tariffs, then the payoffs are shown in the lower left-hand box. The Brazilian payoff is below the diagonal, while the U.S. payoff is above the diagonal. Thus Brazil gets 120 units of welfare, while the United States gets 70 units.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch07_s09_p06">Note that the size of the numbers used in the example is immaterial, but how they relate to the numbers in alternate boxes is not. We will use the results from the tariff analysis section to inform us about the relationship between the numbers.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch07_s09_p07">To begin, let’s assume that each country receives 100 units of national welfare when both the United States and Brazil choose free trade. If Brazil decides to impose optimal tariffs on all of its imports and the United States maintains its free trade position, then a partial equilibrium welfare analysis suggests the following:</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch07_s09_p08">Similarly, if the United States imposes optimal tariffs on all of its imports while Brazil maintains free trade, then the countries will realize the payoffs in the upper right-hand box. The United States would get 120 units of welfare, while Brazil would get 70. To keep the example simple, we are assuming that the effects of tariffs are symmetric. In other words, the effect of U.S. optimal tariffs on the two countries is of the same magnitude as the effects of Brazilian tariffs.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch07_s09_p09">Finally, if both countries set optimal tariffs against each other, then we can simply sum up the total effects.

Afterward, we will consider the outcome when the governments do cooperate.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch07_s09_s01_s01_p01">One can determine a Nash equilibrium in a simple two-player, two-strategy game by choosing a strategy for one of the players and answering the following series of questions:</p>
            <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch07_s09_s01_s01_l01">
                <li>Given the policy choice of the first player, what is the optimal policy of the second player?</li>
                <li>Given the policy choice of the second player (from step one), what is the first player’s optimal policy choice?</li>
                <li>Given player one’s optimal policy choice (from step two), what is the second player’s optimal policy choice?</li>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch07_s09_s01_s01_p04">First, suppose the United States chooses the free trade strategy. Brazil’s optimal policy, given the U.S. choice, is to implement optimal tariffs. This is because 120 units of national welfare are greater than 100 units. Second, if Brazil chooses optimal tariffs, then the optimal policy of the United States is optimal tariffs, since 90 units of welfare are greater than 70 units. Finally, if the United States chooses optimal tariffs, then Brazil’s best choice is optimal tariffs since 90 is greater than 70.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">The Cooperative Solution</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch07_s09_s02_p01">A cooperative solution to a game is a set of strategies that would maximize the sum total of the benefits accruing to the players. In some instances, a cooperative outcome may require the transfer of goods or money between players to assure that each player is made better off than under alternative strategy choices. In this game, such a transfer is not required, however.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch07_s09_s02_p02">The cooperative solution in the trade policy game is the set of strategies (free trade, free trade). At this outcome, total world welfare is at a maximum of 200 units.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Implications and Interpretations</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch07_s09_s03_p01">First of all, notice that in the noncooperative game, each country is acting in its own best interests, yet the outcome is one that is clearly inferior for both countries relative to the cooperative strategy set (free trade, free trade). When both countries set optimal tariffs, each country realizes 90 units of welfare, while if both countries pursued free trade, each country would realizes 100 units of welfare. This kind of result is often referred to as a prisoner’s dilemma outcome. The dilemma is that pursuit of self-interest leads to an inferior outcome for both participants.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch07_s09_s03_p02">However, without cooperation, it may be difficult for the two countries to realize the superior free trade outcome. If both countries begin in free trade, each country has an individual incentive to deviate and implement optimal tariffs. And if either country does deviate, then the other would either suffer the welfare losses caused by the other country’s restrictions or retaliate with tariff increases of its own in order to recoup some of the losses. This scenario in which one country retaliates in response to another’s trade policy could be thought of as a trade war.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch07_s09_s03_p03">This story closely corresponds with events after the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act was passed in the United States in 1930. The Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act raised tariffs to an average rate of 60 percent on many products imported into the United States. Although it is unlikely that the U.S. government set optimal tariffs, the tariffs nevertheless reduced foreign exports to the United States and injured foreign firms. In response to the U.S. tariffs, approximately sixty foreign nations retaliated and raised their tariffs on imports from the United States. The net effect was a substantial reduction in world trade, which very likely contributed to the length and severity of the Great Depression.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch07_s09_s03_p04">After World War II, the United States and other allied nations believed that high restrictions on trade were detrimental to growth in the world economy. The General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) was initiated to promote trade liberalization among its member countries. The method of GATT was to hold multilateral tariff reduction “rounds.” At each round, countries would agree to lower tariffs on imports by a certain average percentage in exchange for a reduction in tariffs by other countries by an equal percentage. Although GATT agreements never achieved a movement to free trade by all member countries, they do represent movements in that direction.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch07_s09_s03_p05">In a sense, then, the GATT represents an international cooperative agreement that facilitates movement toward the free trade strategy set for all countries. If a GATT member nation refuses to reduce its tariffs, then other members refuse to lower theirs. If a GATT member raises its tariffs on some product above the level to which it had previously agreed, then the other member nations are allowed, under the agreement, to retaliate with increases in their own tariffs. In this way, nations have a greater incentive to move in the direction of free trade and a disincentive to take advantage of others by unilaterally raising their tariffs.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch07_s09_s03_p06">The simple prisoner’s dilemma trade policy game therefore offers a simple explanation of the need for international organizations like the GATT or the World Trade Organization (WTO). These agreements may represent methods to achieve cooperative solutions between trading countries.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch07_s10_p01">Suppose Mexico, the importing country in free trade, imposes a binding import quota on wheat. The quota will restrict the flow of wheat across the border. As a result, the supply of wheat to the Mexican market will fall, and if the price remains the same, it will cause excess demand for wheat in the market. The excess demand will induce an increase in the price of wheat. Since wheat is homogeneous and the market is perfectly competitive, the price of all wheat sold in Mexico, both Mexican wheat and U.S. imports, will rise in price. The higher price will, in turn, reduce demand and increase domestic supply, causing a reduction in Mexico’s import demand.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch07_s10_p02">The restricted wheat supply to Mexico will shift supply back to the U.S. market. Since Mexico is assumed to be a large importer, the supply shifted back to the U.S. market will generate excess supply in the U.S. market at the original price and cause a reduction in the U.S. price. The lower price will, in turn, reduce U.S. supply, raise U.S. demand, and cause a reduction in U.S. export supply.</p>

    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch07_s11_p01">When a quantity restriction is set by a government, it must implement procedures to prevent imports beyond the restricted level. A binding import quota will result in a higher price in the import country and, in the case of a large country, a price reduction in the exporter’s market. The price wedge would generate profit opportunities for anyone who could purchase (or produce) the product at the lower price (or cost) in the export market and resell it at the higher price in the import market.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch07_s11_p02">Three basic methods are used to administer import quotas.</p>
    <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch07_s11_l02">
        <li>
<em class="emphasis">Offer quota rights on a first-come, first-served basis</em>. The government could allow imports to enter freely from the start of the year until the quota is filled. Once filled, customs officials would prohibit entry of the product for the remainder of the year. If administered in this way, the quota may result in a fluctuating price for the product over the year. During the open period, a sufficient amount of imports may flow in to achieve free trade prices. Once the window is closed, prices would revert to the autarky prices.</li>
        <li>
<em class="emphasis">Auction quota rights</em>. Essentially, the government could sell quota tickets, where each ticket presented to a customs official would allow the entry of one unit of the good. If the tickets are auctioned, or if the price is determined competitively, the price at which each ticket would be sold is the difference in prices that exists between the export and import market. The holder of a quota ticket can buy the product at the low price in the exporter’s market and resell it at the higher price in the importer’s market. If there are no transportation costs, a quota holder can make a pure profit, called a quota rent, equal to the difference in prices. If the government sells the quota tickets at the maximum attainable price, then the government would receive all the quota rents.</li>
        <li>
<em class="emphasis">Give away quota rights</em>. The government could give away the quota rights by allocating quota tickets to appropriate individuals. The recipient of a quota ticket essentially receives a windfall profit since, in the absence of transportation costs, they can claim the entire quota rent at no cost to themselves. Governments often allocate the quota tickets to domestic importing companies based on past market shares. Thus, if an importer of the product had imported 20 percent of all imports prior to the quota, then it would be given 20 percent of the quota tickets. Sometimes governments give the quota tickets away to foreigners. In this case, the allocation acts as a form of foreign aid since the foreign recipients receive the quota rents. It is worth noting that because quota rents are so valuable, a government can use them to direct rents toward its political supporters.</li>

        <li>If the government gives away the quota rights, then the quota rents accrue to whoever receives these rights. Typically, they would be given to someone in the importing economy, which means that the benefits would remain in the domestic economy.</li>
        <li>If the government gives the quota rights away to foreigners, then the foreigners receive the quota rents. This would imply that these rents should be shifted to the exporting country’s effects and subtracted from the importing country’s effects.</li>
    </ol>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch07_s12_p08"><em class="emphasis">Import quota effects on the importing country</em>. The aggregate welfare effect for the country is found by summing the gains and losses to consumers, producers, and the recipients of the quota rents. Assume that the quota rent recipients are domestic residents. The net effect consists of three components: a positive terms of trade effect (<em class="emphasis">G</em>), a negative production distortion (<em class="emphasis">B</em>), and a negative consumption distortion (<em class="emphasis">D</em>).</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch07_s12_p09">Because there are both positive and negative elements, the net national welfare effect can be either positive or negative. The interesting result, however, is that it can be <em class="emphasis">positive</em>. This means that a quota implemented by a large importing country <em class="emphasis">may</em> raise national welfare.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch07_s12_p10">Generally speaking, the following are true:</p>
    <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch07_s12_l03">
        <li>Whenever a large country implements a small restriction on imports, it will raise national welfare.</li>
        <li>If the quota is too restrictive, national welfare will fall.</li>
        <li>There will be a positive quota level that will maximize national welfare.</li>
    </ol>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch07_s12_p11">However, it is also important to note that not everyone’s welfare rises when there is an increase in national welfare. Instead, there is a redistribution of income. Producers of the product and recipients of the quota rents will benefit, but consumers will lose. A national welfare increase, then, means that the sum of the gains exceeds the sum of the losses across all individuals in the economy. Economists generally argue that, in this case, compensation from winners to losers can potentially alleviate the redistribution problem.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch07_s12_p12"><em class="emphasis">Import quota effects on the exporting country’s consumers</em>. Consumers of the product in the exporting country experience an increase in well-being as a result of the quota. The decrease in their domestic price raises the amount of consumer surplus in the market.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch07_s12_p13"><em class="emphasis">Import quota effects on the exporting country’s producers</em>. Producers in the exporting country experience a decrease in well-being as a result of the quota. The decrease in the price of their product in their own market decreases producer surplus in the industry. The price decline also induces a decrease in output, a decrease in employment, and a decrease in profit, payments, or both to fixed costs.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch07_s12_p14"><em class="emphasis">Import quota effects on the quota rents</em>. There are no quota rent effects on the exporting country as a result of the importer’s quota unless the importing government gives away the quota rights to foreigners. Only in this case would the rents accrue to someone in the exporting country.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch07_s12_p15"><em class="emphasis">Import quota effects on the exporting country</em>. The aggregate welfare effect for the country is found by summing the gains and losses to consumers and producers. The net effect consists of three components: a negative terms of trade effect (<em class="emphasis">g</em>), a negative consumption distortion (<em class="emphasis">f</em>), and a negative production distortion (<em class="emphasis">h</em>).</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch07_s12_p16">Since all three components are negative, the importer’s tariff must result in a reduction in national welfare for the exporting country. However, it is important to note that a redistribution of income occurs—that is, some groups gain while others lose. In this case, the sum of the losses exceeds the sum of the gains.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch07_s12_p17"><em class="emphasis">Import quota effects on world welfare</em>. The effect on world welfare is found by summing the national welfare effects on the importing and exporting countries. By noting that the terms of trade gain to the importer is equal to the terms of trade loss to the exporter, the world welfare effect reduces to four components: the importer’s negative production distortion (<em class="emphasis">B</em>), the importer’s negative consumption distortion (<em class="emphasis">D</em>), the exporter’s negative consumption distortion (<em class="emphasis">f</em>), and the exporter’s negative production distortion (<em class="emphasis">h</em>). Since each of these is negative, the world welfare effect of the import quota is negative. The sum of the losses in the world exceeds the sum of the gains. In other words, we can say that an import quota results in a reduction in world production and consumption efficiency.</p>

Thus when a quota is implemented by a small country, there is no effect on the world price.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch07_s13_p02">To depict the price effects of a quota, we use an export supply/import demand diagram shown in <a class="xref" href="#fwk-61960-ch07_s13_f01">Figure 7.26 "Depicting a Quota Equilibrium: Small Country Case"</a>. The export supply curve is drawn as a horizontal line since the exporting country is willing to supply as much as the importer demands at the world price. The small importing country takes the world price as exogenous since it can have no effect on it.</p>

The reduced supply raises the domestic price. The world price is unaffected by the quota and remains at the free trade level.

            <li>Understand the pros and cons of applying tariffs versus quotas.</li>
            <li>Learn how tariffs differ from quotas in their protective effects in the face of market changes.</li>
        </ol>
    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch07_s15_p01">There are two basic ways to provide protection to domestic import-competing industries: a tariff or a quota. The choice between one or the other is likely to depend on several concerns.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch07_s15_p02">One concern is the revenue effects. A tariff has an immediate advantage for governments in that it will automatically generate tariff revenue (assuming the tariff is not prohibitive). Quotas may or may not generate revenue depending on how the quota is administered. If a quota is administered by selling quota tickets (i.e., import rights), then a quota will generate government revenue; however, if the quota is administered on a first-come, first-served basis or if quota tickets are given away, then no revenue is collected.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch07_s15_p03">Administrative costs of tariffs and quotas are also likely to differ. Tariff collection involves product identification, collection, and processing of fees. Quota administration will also involve product identification and some method of keeping track of, or counting, the product as it enters the country in multiple ports of entry. It may also involve some method of auctioning or disbursing quota tickets. It is not obvious which of these two procedures would be less costly, although a good guess would be tariff collection.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch07_s15_p04">Perhaps the most important distinction between the two policies, however, is the protective effect the policy has on the import-competing industries. In one sense, quotas are more protective of the domestic industry because they limit the extent of import competition to a fixed maximum quantity. The quota provides an upper bound to the foreign competition the domestic industries will face. In contrast, tariffs simply raise the price but do not limit the degree of competition or trade volume to any particular level.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch07_s15_p05">In the original General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), a preference for the application of tariffs rather than quotas was introduced as a guiding principle. One reason was the sense that tariffs allowed for more market flexibility and thus could be expected to be less protective over time. Another reason concerned transparency. With a quota in place, it is very difficult to discern the degree to which a market is protected since it can be difficult to measure how far the quota is below the free trade import level. With a tariff in place, especially an ad valorem tariff, one can use the tariff percentage as a measure of the degree of protection.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch07_s15_p06">Also, it was considered somewhat easier to negotiate reductions in tariff rates than quota increases during GATT rounds of trade liberalization. Again, the issue of transparency arises. Trade liberalization agreements generally target a fixed percentage for tariff reductions. For example, countries might agree to reduce average tariffs by 30 percent from their current levels. This rule would be perceived as being equal reciprocation in that each country would be liberalizing to the same degree. Hence the agreement could be judged to be fair. However, with quotas in place, it would be difficult, if not impossible, to apply such a straightforward type of fairness principle.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch07_s15_p07">For this reason, current World Trade Organization (WTO) member countries agreed in the Uruguay Round to phase out the use of quotas, used primarily in agriculture industries. Instead, countries will apply tariffs that are equivalent in their market effects to the original quotas. This adjustment is referred to as tariffication. In this way, future rounds of trade liberalization negotiations will be able to use fair reciprocal concessions to bring these tariffs down further.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">The Protective Effects of Tariffs versus Quotas with Market Changes</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch07_s15_s01_p01">One of the main concerns in choosing between tariffs or quotas is the protective effect of the policy. Although tariffs and quotas are generally equivalent to each other in terms of their static price and welfare effects, this equivalence does not remain true in the face of market changes. In the next sections we consider three such market changes: an increase in domestic demand, an increase in domestic supply, and a decrease in the world price. In each case, we compare the protective effects of a tariff and a quota for the domestic import-competing industries.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">The General Rule</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch07_s15_s01_s04_p01">What we can conclude from the three examples above is that when market conditions change such that imports increase, a quota is more protective than a tariff. This will occur if domestic demand increases, domestic supply decreases, the world price falls, or if some combination of these things occur.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch07_s15_s01_s04_p02">In situations where market changes cause a decrease in imports, a tariff is more protective than a quota. This occurs if domestic demand falls, domestic supply rises, the world price rises, or some combination of these changes occurs.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch07_s15_s01_s04_p03">Since protection is often provided due to the insistence of the domestic import-competing industries—rather than a more comprehensive concern for the general welfare of the country—and since import-competing firms are generally more concerned about situations where imports may increase, industry preferences usually favor quotas over tariffs since quotas will be more protective in these situations. Other government concerns, such as revenue needs, ease of administration, or participation in trade agreements like the GATT/WTO, which contain a preference of tariffs over quotas, have resulted in the widespread application of tariffs rather than quotas in most instances.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch07_s16_p01">Suppose the United States, the exporting country in free trade, implements a specific export subsidy on exports of wheat. A subsidy to exports will encourage the flow of wheat across the border. It will now cost less to move the product from the United States into Mexico.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch07_s16_p02">As a result, the supply of wheat to the Mexican market will rise, causing a decrease in the price of wheat. Since the United States is assumed to be a large country, the price of all wheat sold in Mexico, both Mexican wheat and U.S. imports, will fall in price. The lower price will raise Mexico’s import demand.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch07_s16_p03">The higher wheat supply to Mexico will reduce supply in the U.S. market and induce an increase in the U.S. price. The higher price will raise U.S. export supply.</p>

The first condition represents a price wedge between the final U.S. price and the Mexican price equal to the amount of the export subsidy. The prices must differ by the subsidy because U.S. suppliers of wheat must receive the same price for their product, regardless of whether the product is sold in the United States or Mexico, and all wheat sold in Mexico must be sold at the same price. Since a subsidy is paid to U.S. exporters, the only way for these price equalities within countries to arise is if the price differs across countries by the amount of the subsidy.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch07_s16_p07">The second condition states that the amount the United States wants to export at its new higher price must be equal to the amount Mexico wants to import at its new lower price.

    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch07_s17_p07"><em class="emphasis">Export subsidy effects on the exporting country’s government</em>. The government must pay the subsidy to exporters. These payments must come out of the general government budget. Who loses as a result of the subsidy payments depends on how the revenue is collected. If there is no change in total spending when the subsidy payments are made, then a reallocation of funds implies that funding to some other government program is reduced. If the subsidy is funded by raising tax revenues, then the individuals responsible for the higher taxes lose out. If the government borrows money to finance the subsidy payments, then the budget cut or the tax increase can be postponed until some future date. Regardless of how the subsidy is funded, however, someone in the domestic economy must ultimately pay for it.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch07_s17_p08"><em class="emphasis">Export subsidy effects on the exporting country</em>. The aggregate welfare effect for the country is found by summing the gains and losses to consumers and producers. The net effect consists of three components: a negative terms of trade effect (<em class="emphasis">f</em> + <em class="emphasis">g</em> + <em class="emphasis">h</em>), a negative consumption distortion (<em class="emphasis">b</em>), and a negative production distortion (<em class="emphasis">d</em>).</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch07_s17_p09">Since all three components are negative, the export subsidy must result in a reduction in national welfare for the exporting country. However, it is important to note that a redistribution of income occurs—that is, some groups gain while others lose. The likely reason governments implement export subsidies is because they will benefit domestic exporting firms. The concerns of consumers must be weighed less heavily in their calculation since the sum of their losses exceeds the sum of the producers’ gains.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch07_s17_p10"><em class="emphasis">Export subsidy effects on the importing country’s consumers</em>. Consumers of the product in the importing country experience an increase in well-being as a result of the export subsidy. The decrease in the price of both imported goods and the domestic substitutes increases the amount of consumer surplus in the market.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch07_s17_p11"><em class="emphasis">Export subsidy effects on the importing country’s producers</em>. Producers in the importing country suffer a decrease in well-being as a result of the export subsidy. The decrease in the price of their product on the domestic market reduces producer surplus in the industry. The price decrease also induces a decrease in the output of existing firms, a decrease in employment, and a decrease in profit, payments, or both to fixed costs.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch07_s17_p12"><em class="emphasis">Export subsidy effects on the importing country’s government</em>. There is no effect on the importing country’s government revenue as a result of the exporter’s subsidy.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch07_s17_p13"><em class="emphasis">Export subsidy effects on the importing country</em>. The aggregate welfare effect for the country is found by summing the gains and losses to consumers, producers, and the government. The net effect consists of three components: a positive terms of trade effect (<em class="emphasis">F</em> + <em class="emphasis">G</em> + <em class="emphasis">H</em>), a negative production distortion (<em class="emphasis">F</em>), and a negative consumption distortion (<em class="emphasis">H</em>).</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch07_s17_p14">Although there are both positive and negative elements, the net national welfare effect reduces to area <em class="emphasis">G</em>, which is positive. This means that an export subsidy implemented by a large exporting country in a perfectly competitive market <em class="emphasis">will</em> raise national welfare in the importing country.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch07_s17_p15">This result has inspired some economists to argue that the proper response for an importing country when its trading partner implements an export subsidy is simply to send along a thank you note.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch07_s17_p16">It is worth noting here that the World Trade Organization (WTO) allows countries to impose countervailing duties to retaliate against its trading partners when it can be shown that an exporting country’s government has used export subsidies.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch07_s17_p17">It is also important to note that not everyone’s welfare rises when there is an increase in national welfare. Instead, there is a redistribution of income. Consumers of the product will benefit, but producers and payers of government taxes will lose. A national welfare increase, then, means that the sum of the gains exceeds the sum of the losses across all individuals in the economy. Economists generally argue that, in this case, compensation from winners to losers can potentially alleviate the redistribution problem.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch07_s17_p18"><em class="emphasis">Export subsidy effects on world welfare</em>. The effect on world welfare is found by summing the national welfare effects on the importing and exporting countries. By noting that the terms of trade gain to the exporter is equal to the terms of trade loss to the importer, the world welfare effect reduces to four components: the importer’s negative production distortion (<em class="emphasis">B</em>), the importer’s negative consumption distortion (<em class="emphasis">D</em>), the exporter’s negative consumption distortion (<em class="emphasis">f</em>), and the exporter’s negative production distortion (<em class="emphasis">h</em>). Since each of these is negative, the world welfare effect of the export subsidy is negative. The sum of the losses in the world exceeds the sum of the gains. In other words, we can say that an export subsidy results in a reduction in world production and consumption efficiency.</p>

Because of the cost of the subsidy to the exporting country government, which must ultimately be paid by the taxpayers, the net national welfare effect for the exporting country is negative.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch07_s18_s01_p07">The importing country also experiences an income redistribution. The consumers in the importing country benefit from the foreign subsidy, while import-competing producers suffer losses. The net effect for the importing country is positive since the gains to consumers outweigh the losses to producers.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">The Countervailing Duty</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch07_s18_s02_p01">Despite the fact that the export subsidy generates net benefits for the importing country, the importing country is allowed under WTO rules to protect itself from these benefits. A CVD may be placed if it can be shown that a subsidy is indeed in place and if the subsidy causes injury to the import-competing firms.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch07_s18_s02_p02">It is worth emphasizing that the antisubsidy law, in this case, does not protect the “country,” nor does it protect consumers. The law is designed to aid import firms exclusively. No evaluation of the effects on consumers and no evaluation of the national welfare effects are required by the law. The only requirement is that injury be caused to the import-competing firms.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch07_s18_s02_p03">In this simple example of a large country implementing an export subsidy, injury would indeed be apparent. The export subsidy lowers the price of the good in the import market in this model and causes an increase in imports from abroad. Supply by the import-competing firms would fall (from <em class="emphasis">S</em><sub class="subscript">0</sub><sup class="superscript"><em class="emphasis">IM</em></sup> to <em class="emphasis">S</em><sub class="subscript">1</sub><sup class="superscript"><em class="emphasis">IM</em></sup> in <a class="xref" href="#fwk-61960-ch07_s18_s01_f01">Figure 7.33 "Depicting an Export Subsidy and a CVD"</a>). Producer surplus, indicating a reduction in industry profits, would also fall. Since less output would be produced by the import-competing industry, the industry would need fewer factors of production. This would likely mean a reduction in the number of workers employed in the industry. In the adjustment process, firms in the industry may lay off workers and close factories. All these effects are valid criteria used to judge injury in CVD cases.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch07_s18_s02_p04">So let’s consider the effects of a countervailing duty in response to the export subsidy described above. A CVD is simply a tariff set on imports to counter the effects of the foreign export subsidy. CVD laws require that the size of the CVD be just enough to offset the effects of the export subsidy. In the United States, the U.S. International Trade Administration determines the size of the foreign subsidy. If a CVD action is taken, the CVD is set equal to the foreign subsidy.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch07_s18_s02_p05">So imagine that the importing country now sets a specific CVD (<em class="emphasis">t</em>) equal to the original export subsidy (<em class="emphasis">S</em>). As with any tariff set by a large importing country, the tariff will cause the price in the importing country to rise and the price in the exporting country to fall. What’s different from the standard tariff analysis is that the prices in this case are not equal to each other. Instead, the price in the import market begins lower—by the amount of the export subsidy, <em class="emphasis">S</em>—than the price in the export market. The CVD, then, will drive the prices in the two markets back together.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch07_s18_s02_p06">The final equilibrium must satisfy the following two conditions:</p>

        <p class="para block" id="fwk-61960-ch07_s18_s02_p08">However, since <em class="emphasis">t</em> = <em class="emphasis">S</em>, the first condition reduces to <span class="inlineequation"><math xml:id="fwk-61960_ch07_s18_m007" display="inline"><mrow><msubsup><mi>P</mi><mrow><mi>S</mi><mo>+</mo><mi>t</mi></mrow><mrow><mi>E</mi><mi>X</mi></mrow></msubsup><mo>=</mo><msubsup><mi>P</mi><mrow><mi>S</mi><mo>+</mo><mi>t</mi></mrow><mrow><mi>I</mi><mi>M</mi></mrow></msubsup></mrow></math></span>.

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch07_s18_s02_p09">Thus the effect of the CVD is to force the prices in the two markets back to the free trade prices.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch07_s18_s02_p10">As a result, imports will fall in the importing country (back to <em class="emphasis">D</em><sub class="subscript">0</sub><sup class="superscript"><em class="emphasis">IM</em></sup> − <em class="emphasis">S</em><sub class="subscript">0</sub><sup class="superscript"><em class="emphasis">IM</em></sup> in <a class="xref" href="#fwk-61960-ch07_s18_s01_f01">Figure 7.33 "Depicting an Export Subsidy and a CVD"</a>), domestic supply will rise (from <em class="emphasis">S</em><sub class="subscript">1</sub><sup class="superscript"><em class="emphasis">IM</em></sup> to <em class="emphasis">S</em><sub class="subscript">0</sub><sup class="superscript"><em class="emphasis">IM</em></sup>), employment in the import-competing industry will rise, and producer surplus in the industry will also rise.

Thus producers in the import-competing industry gain in surplus from the CVD exactly what they had lost as a result of the foreign export subsidy. Consumers in the import industry lose from the CVD, producers in the exporting country lose, and consumers in the exporting country gain.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch07_s18_s03_p04">The importing government now collects tariff revenue from the CVD, which benefits someone in the importing country. The exporting government, however, experiences a reduction in its subsidy expenditures. This occurs because the CVD reduces trade and thus reduces the number of units exported. As a result, the government (i.e., the taxpayers) in the exporting country benefits from the CVD.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch07_s18_s03_p05">The national welfare effects in both countries are ambiguous in general. In the importing country, a terms of trade gain may outweigh two deadweight losses and cause national welfare to rise even further. Interestingly, the export subsidy and the CVD may each raise welfare for the importing country. In the export country, the net national welfare effect may be positive or negative.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch07_s18_s03_p06">The world welfare effects are found by summing the national welfare effects on both countries.

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch07_s18_s04_p03">Since the prices in each country after the CVD are the same as prices before the export subsidy, there is ultimately no change in producer or consumer surplus in either country. Everyone participating in the market is left as well off as they were at the start.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch07_s18_s04_p04">However, since the exporting country maintains the export subsidy and the import country maintains the CVD, there are government revenue effects. In the exporting country, the government continues to make expenditures for the export subsidy. This represents a cost to the country’s taxpayers that does not even generate the intended benefit for the export industry. In the importing country, the government collects tariff revenue as a result of the CVD. This generates benefits to the recipients of the resulting additional government spending.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch07_s18_s04_p05">The net national welfare effect in each country is the same as the government effects.

This means that the exporting country loses exactly the same amount as the importing country gains. The ultimate effect of the export subsidy plus the CVD is that the exporting country’s government transfers money to the importing country’s government with consumers and producers left unaffected. In practice, exporting country producers receive an export subsidy payment from their government when their product leaves the port bound for the importing country. When the product arrives, the importing country’s government collects a tariff (or a CVD) exactly equal to the subsidy payment. Thus the export firms turn over the extra monies they had just received from their own government to the government of the importing country.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch07_s19_p01">Suppose the United States, an exporting country in free trade, imposes a binding export quota, often called a voluntary export restraint (VER) when implemented bilaterally, on wheat exports to Mexico. The VER will restrict the flow of wheat across the border. Since the United States is a large exporter, the supply of wheat to the Mexican market will fall, and if the price remained the same it would cause excess demand for wheat in the market. The excess demand will induce an increase in the price of wheat. Since wheat is homogeneous and the market is perfectly competitive, the price of all wheat sold in Mexico, both Mexican wheat and U.S. imports, will rise in price. The higher price will, in turn, reduce demand and increase domestic supply, causing a reduction in Mexico’s import demand.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch07_s19_p02">The restricted wheat supply to Mexico will shift supply back to the U.S. market, causing excess supply in the U.S. market at the original price and a reduction in the U.S. price. The lower price will, in turn, reduce U.S. supply, raise U.S. demand, and cause a reduction in U.S. export supply.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch07_s19_p03">These price effects are identical in direction to the price effects of an import tax and an import quota by the importer country, and an export tax by the exporting country.</p>

            <li>Learn the ways in which a voluntary export restraint (VER) can be implemented to monitor and assure that only the specified amount is exported to the targeted country.</li>
        </ol>
    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch07_s20_p01">When a government sets a quantity restriction, the government must implement procedures to prevent exports beyond the restricted level. A binding voluntary export restraint (VER) will result in a higher price in the import country and in the case of a large country, a reduction in the price in the exporter’s market. The price wedge would generate profit opportunities for anyone who could purchase (or produce) the product at the lower price (or cost) in the export market and resell it at the higher price in the import market.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch07_s20_p02">Three basic methods are used to administer VERs.</p>
    <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch07_s20_l02">
        <li>
<em class="emphasis">Offer export rights on a first-come, first-served basis</em>. The government could allow exports to exit freely from the start of the year until the VER limit is reached. Once filled, customs officials would prohibit export of the product for the remainder of the year. If administered in this way, the VER may result in a fluctuating price for the product over the year. During the open period, a sufficient amount of imports may flow in to achieve free trade prices. Once the window is closed, prices would revert to the autarky prices.</li>
        <li>
<em class="emphasis">Auction export rights</em>. Essentially the government could sell quota tickets where each ticket presented to a customs official would allow the exit of one unit of the good. If the tickets are auctioned, or if the price is determined competitively, the price at which each ticket would be sold is the difference in prices that exist between the export and import market. The holder of a quota ticket can buy the product at the low price in the exporter’s market and resell it at the higher price in the importer’s market. If there are no transportation costs, a quota holder can make a pure profit, called a quota rent, equal to the difference in prices. If the government sells the quota tickets at the maximum attainable price, then the government would receive all the quota rents.</li>
        <li>
<em class="emphasis">Give away export rights</em>. The government could give away the export rights by allocating quota tickets to appropriate individuals. The recipient of a quota ticket essentially receives a windfall profit since, in the absence of transportation costs, they can claim the entire quota rent at no cost to themselves. Many times governments allocate the quota tickets to domestic exporting companies based on past market shares. Thus, if an exporter had exported 40 percent of all exports before the VER, then it would be given 40 percent of the quota tickets. It is worth noting that because quota rents are so valuable, a governmen can use them to direct rents toward its political supporters.</li>

        <li>If the government gives away the quota rights, then the quota rents accrue to whoever receives these rights. Typically, they would be given to the exporting producers, which would serve to offset the producer surplus losses. It is conceivable that the quota rents may exceed the surplus loss so that the export industry is better off with the VER than without. Regardless, the benefits would remain in the domestic economy.</li>
    </ol>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch07_s21_p08"><em class="emphasis">VER effects on the exporting country</em>. The aggregate welfare effect for the country is found by summing the gains and losses to consumers, producers, and the recipients of the quota rents. The net effect consists of three components: a positive terms of trade effect (<em class="emphasis">c</em>), a negative production distortion (<em class="emphasis">h</em>), and a negative consumption distortion (<em class="emphasis">f</em>).</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch07_s21_p09">Because there are both positive and negative elements, the net national welfare effect can be either positive or negative. The interesting result, however, is that it can be <em class="emphasis">positive</em>. This means that a VER implemented by a large exporting country <em class="emphasis">may</em> raise national welfare.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch07_s21_p10">Generally speaking, the following are true:</p>
    <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch07_s21_l03">
        <li>Whenever a large country implements a small restriction on exports, it will raise national welfare.</li>
        <li>If the VER is too restrictive, national welfare will fall.</li>
        <li>There will be a positive quota level that will maximize national welfare.</li>
    </ol>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch07_s21_p11">However, it is also important to note that not everyone’s welfare rises when there is an increase in national welfare. Instead, there is a redistribution of income. Consumers of the product and recipients of the quota rents will benefit, but producers may lose. A national welfare increase, then, means that the sum of the gains exceeds the sum of the losses across all individuals in the economy. Economists generally argue that, in this case, compensation from winners to losers can potentially alleviate the redistribution problem.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch07_s21_p12"><em class="emphasis">VER effects on the importing country’s consumers</em>. Consumers of the product in the importing country suffer a reduction in well-being as a result of the VER. The increase in the domestic price of both imported goods and the domestic substitutes reduces the amount of consumer surplus in the market.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch07_s21_p13"><em class="emphasis">VER effects on the importing country’s producers</em>. Producers in the importing country experience an increase in well-being as a result of the VER. The increase in the price of their product increases producer surplus in the industry. The price increases also induce an increase in the output of existing firms (and perhaps the addition of new firms), an increase in employment, and an increase in profit, payments, or both to fixed costs.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch07_s21_p14"><em class="emphasis">VER effects on the importing country</em>. The aggregate welfare effect for the country is found by summing the gains and losses to consumers and producers. The net effect consists of three components: a negative terms of trade effect (<em class="emphasis">C</em>), a negative consumption distortion (<em class="emphasis">D</em>), and a negative production distortion (<em class="emphasis">B</em>).</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch07_s21_p15">Since all three components are negative, the VER must result in a reduction in national welfare for the importing country. However, it is important to note that a redistribution of income occurs—that is, some groups gain while others lose. This is especially important because VERs are often suggested by the importing country. This occurs because the importing country’s government is pressured by the import-competing producers to provide protection in the form of an import tariff or quota. Government reluctance to use these policies often leads the importer to negotiate VERs with the exporting country. Although the importing country’s national welfare is reduced, the import-competing producers gain nonetheless.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch07_s21_p16"><em class="emphasis">VER effects on world welfare</em>. The effect on world welfare is found by summing the national welfare effects on the importing and exporting countries. By noting that the terms of trade gain to the importer is equal to the terms of trade loss to the exporter, the world welfare effect reduces to four components: the importer’s negative production distortion (<em class="emphasis">B</em>), the importer’s negative consumption distortion (<em class="emphasis">D</em>), the exporter’s negative consumption distortion (<em class="emphasis">f</em>), and the exporter’s negative production distortion (<em class="emphasis">h</em>). Since each of these is negative, the world welfare effect of the VER is negative. The sum of the losses in the world exceeds the sum of the gains. In other words, we can say that a VER results in a reduction in world production and consumption efficiency.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch07_s22_p01">Suppose the United States, the exporting country in free trade, imposes a specific export tax on exports of wheat. A tax on exports will reduce the flow of wheat across the border. It will now cost more to move the product from the United States into Mexico.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch07_s22_p02">As a result, the supply of wheat to the Mexican market will fall, inducing an increase in the price of wheat. Since the United States is assumed to be a large country, the price of all wheat sold in Mexico, both Mexican wheat and U.S. imports, will rise in price. The higher price will reduce Mexico’s import demand.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch07_s22_p03">The reduced wheat supply to Mexico will shift supply back to the U.S. market and induce a reduction in the U.S. price. The lower price will reduce U.S. export supply.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch07_s22_p04">These price effects are identical in direction to the price effects of a tariff, an import quota, and a voluntary export restraint.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch07_s22_p08">The first condition represents a price wedge between the final U.S. price and the Mexican price equal to the amount of the export tax. The prices must differ from the tax because U.S. suppliers of wheat must receive the same price for their product regardless of whether the product is sold in the United States or Mexico, and all wheat sold in Mexico must be sold at the same price. Since a tax is collected at the border, the only way for these price equalities within countries to arise is if the price differs across countries by the amount of the tax.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch07_s22_p09">The second condition states that the amount the United States wants to export at its new lower price must be equal to the amount Mexico wants to import at its new higher price.

    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch07_s23_p05"><em class="emphasis">Export tax effects on the exporting country’s consumers</em>. Consumers of the product in the exporting country experience an increase in well-being as a result of the export tax. The decrease in their domestic price raises the amount of consumer surplus in the market.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch07_s23_p06"><em class="emphasis">Export tax effects on the exporting country’s producers</em>. Producers in the exporting country experience a decrease in well-being as a result of the tax. The decrease in the price of their product in their own market decreases producer surplus in the industry. The price decline also induces a decrease in output, a decrease in employment, and a decrease in profit, payments, or both to fixed costs.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch07_s23_p07"><em class="emphasis">Export tax effects on the exporting country’s government</em>. The government receives tax revenue as a result of the export tax. Who benefits from the revenue depends on how the government spends it. Typically, the revenue is simply included as part of the general funds collected by the government from various sources. In this case, it is impossible to identify precisely who benefits. However, these funds help support many government spending programs, which presumably help either most people in the country, as is the case with public goods, or certain worthy groups. Thus someone within the country is the likely recipient of these benefits.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch07_s23_p08"><em class="emphasis">Export tax effects on the exporting country</em>. The aggregate welfare effect for the country is found by summing the gains and losses to consumers and producers. The net effect consists of three components: a positive terms of trade effect (<em class="emphasis">c</em>), a negative consumption distortion (<em class="emphasis">f</em>), and a negative production distortion (<em class="emphasis">h</em>).</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch07_s23_p09">Because there are both positive and negative elements, the net national welfare effect can be either positive or negative. The interesting result, however, is that it can be <em class="emphasis">positive</em>. This means that an export tax implemented by a large exporting country <em class="emphasis">may</em> raise national welfare.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch07_s23_p10">Generally speaking, the following are true:</p>
    <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch07_s23_l02">
        <li>Whenever a large country implements a small export tax, it will raise national welfare.</li>
        <li>If the tax is set too high, national welfare will fall.</li>
        <li>There will be a positive optimal export tax that will maximize national welfare.</li>
    </ol>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch07_s23_p11">However, it is also important to note that not everyone’s welfare rises when there is an increase in national welfare. Instead, there is a redistribution of income. Producers of the product and recipients of government spending will benefit, but consumers will lose. A national welfare increase, then, means that the sum of the gains exceeds the sum of the losses across all individuals in the economy. Economists generally argue that, in this case, compensation from winners to losers can potentially alleviate the redistribution problem.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch07_s23_p12"><em class="emphasis">Export tax effects on the importing country’s consumers</em>. Consumers of the product in the importing country suffer a reduction in well-being as a result of the export tax. The increase in the price of both imported goods and the domestic substitutes reduces the amount of consumer surplus in the market.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch07_s23_p13"><em class="emphasis">Export tax effects on the importing country’s producers</em>. Producers in the importing country experience an increase in well-being as a result of the export tax. The increase in the price of their product on the domestic market increases producer surplus in the industry. The price increase also induces an increase in the output of existing firms (and perhaps the addition of new firms), an increase in employment, and an increase in profit, payments, or both to fixed costs.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch07_s23_p14"><em class="emphasis">Export tax effects on the importing country’s government</em>. There is no effect on the importing country’s government revenue as a result of the exporter’s tax.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch07_s23_p15"><em class="emphasis">Export tax effects on the importing country</em>. The aggregate welfare effect for the country is found by summing the gains and losses to consumers, producers, and the government. The net effect consists of three components: a negative terms of trade effect (<em class="emphasis">C</em>), a negative production distortion (<em class="emphasis">B</em>), and a negative consumption distortion (<em class="emphasis">D</em>).</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch07_s23_p16">Since all three components are negative, the export tax must result in a reduction in national welfare for the importing country. However, it is important to note that a redistribution of income occurs—that is, some groups gain while others lose. In this case, the sum of the losses exceeds the sum of the gains.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch07_s23_p17"><em class="emphasis">Export tax effects on world welfare</em>. The effect on world welfare is found by summing the national welfare effects on the importing and exporting countries. By noting that the terms of trade gain to the exporter is equal to the terms of trade loss to the importer, the world welfare effect reduces to four components: the importer’s negative production distortion (<em class="emphasis">B</em>), the importer’s negative consumption distortion (<em class="emphasis">D</em>), the exporter’s negative consumption distortion (<em class="emphasis">f</em>), and the exporter’s negative production distortion (<em class="emphasis">h</em>). Since each of these is negative, the world welfare effect of the export tax is negative. The sum of the losses in the world exceeds the sum of the gains. In other words, we can say that an export tax results in a reduction in world production and consumption efficiency.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch09_s09_p01">One contentious issue in international trade policy discussions concerns the connection between international trade and the environment. Many environmental groups claim that freer trade, as implemented through the World Trade Organization (WTO) agreements or in free trade agreements such as the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), results in negative environmental outcomes. For example, the Sierra Club argues, “Economic globalization ties the world together as never before. But it also poses serious new threats to our health and the environment. Trade agreements promote international commerce by limiting governments’ ability to act in the public interest. Already food safety, wildlife and pollution control laws have been challenged and weakened under trade rules as illegal ‘barriers to trade.’”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-surantrade-fn09_004">Sierra Club, “A Fair Trade Bill of Rights,” Responsible Trade, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.sierraclub.org/trade/ftaa/rights.asp">http://www.sierraclub.org/trade/ftaa/rights.asp</a>.</span></p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch09_s09_p02">In contrast, the WTO, a frequent target for criticism by environmental groups, points to the WTO agreement, which states, “[WTO member] relations in the field of trade and economic endeavor should be conducted with a view to raising standards of living…while allowing for the optimal use of the world’s resources in accordance with the objective of sustainable development, seeking both to protect and preserve the environment and to enhance the means for doing so in a manner consistent with their respective needs and concerns at different levels of economic development.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-surantrade-fn09_005">World Trade Organization, “Environment Issues: Sustainable development,” <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/envir_e/sust_dev_e.htm">http://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/envir_e/sust_dev_e.htm</a>.</span></p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch09_s09_p03">Arguably, the stated goals of free trade–oriented groups and environmental groups are very similar, at least as highlighted in the documents produced by both sides. What differ are the methods used to achieve the objectives. For reasons to be elucidated below, the WTO has argued that environmental concerns are not directly within the purview of the WTO agreement, but despite that, environmental policies and international environmental agreements are neither prohibited by nor inconsistent with the WTO accords. In essence, the argument by some has been that the WTO agreement, and free trade agreements more generally, is intended to be about trade and is not intended to solve tangential problems related to the environment. On the other hand, environmental groups have pointed out that sometimes WTO and free trade agreement decisions have a negative effect on environmental outcomes, and thus these agreements should be revised to account for these negative effects.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch09_s09_p04">Below we will consider these issues with respect to one type of environmental concern: pollution caused by consumption of an imported good. Although we will not consider many of the other contested environmental and trade issues, this one example will suffice to establish some important and generalizable conclusions.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch09_s09_s01_p01">Consider a small country importing gasoline with a tariff in place initially such that the domestic tariff-inclusive price is <em class="emphasis">P</em><sub class="subscript">1</sub>.

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch09_s09_s01_p02">Suppose that domestic consumption of gasoline causes air pollution. This means that consumption has a negative external effect on all users of air—that is, there is a negative consumption externality.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch09_s09_s01_p03">Let’s assume that the cost to society (in dollar terms) of the air pollution is an increasing function of domestic consumption. In other words, the greater the consumption of gasoline, the greater is the pollution, and the greater is the subsequent harm caused to people in the country. For simplicity, assume the environmental cost, <em class="emphasis">EC</em>(<em class="emphasis">D</em>), is a linear function of total domestic demand, <em class="emphasis">D</em>. The height of <em class="emphasis">EC</em> at any level of demand represents the additional dollar cost of an additional gallon of gasoline consumption. This implies the total environmental cost of a consumption level—say, <em class="emphasis">D</em><sub class="subscript">2</sub>—is the area under the <em class="emphasis">EC</em> curve between the origin and <em class="emphasis">D</em><sub class="subscript">2</sub>.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch09_s09_s01_p04">With the initial tariff in place, domestic demand is <em class="emphasis">D</em><sub class="subscript">1</sub>, which implies that the total societal cost of pollution is given by the area (<em class="emphasis">h</em> + <em class="emphasis">i</em> + <em class="emphasis">j</em>). Note that despite the cost of pollution, it does make sense to produce and consume this good if the objective is national welfare. Consumer surplus is given by the area (<em class="emphasis">a</em> + <em class="emphasis">b</em>) and producer surplus is (<em class="emphasis">c</em> + <em class="emphasis">g</em>). The sum of these two clearly exceeds the social cost of pollution, (<em class="emphasis">h</em> + <em class="emphasis">i</em> + <em class="emphasis">j</em>). (Note that these statements are true for <a class="xref" href="#fwk-61960-ch09_s09_s01_f01">Figure 9.8 "Trade and Environmental Costs"</a> in particular; they are not true in general. By drawing the <em class="emphasis">EC</em> curve very steeply, corresponding to a much higher cost of pollution, it might not make sense to produce and consume the good in the market equilibrium.)</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch09_s09_s01_p05">Next, suppose that the country agrees to remove the tariff on imported gasoline after signing a trade liberalization agreement. The question we ask is, Can trade liberalization have such a negative effect on the environment that it makes a country worse off? The answer, as we’ll see, is yes.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch09_s09_s01_p06">Suppose the tariff is removed and the price of gasoline falls to <em class="emphasis">P</em><sub class="subscript">2</sub>. The lower price causes a reduction in production to <em class="emphasis">S</em><sub class="subscript">2</sub>, an increase in consumption to <em class="emphasis">D</em><sub class="subscript">2</sub>, and an increase in imports from the blue line segment (<em class="emphasis">D</em><sub class="subscript">1</sub> − <em class="emphasis">S</em><sub class="subscript">1</sub>) to the red line segment (<em class="emphasis">D</em><sub class="subscript">2</sub> − <em class="emphasis">S</em><sub class="subscript">2</sub>).

            <h2 class="title editable block">Trade Policy versus Domestic Policy</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch09_s09_s01_s01_p01">In general, the theory of the second best suggests that, in the presence of a market imperfection or distortion, a properly chosen trade policy might be found that will raise a small country’s national welfare. However, for most imperfections, a trade policy will be a second-best policy. A better policy, a first-best policy, will always be that policy that attacks the imperfection or distortion most directly. In most instances, the first-best policy will be a domestic policy rather than a trade policy.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch09_s09_s01_s01_p02">In this case, environmental pollution caused by the consumption of gasoline is a market imperfection because gasoline consumption has a negative external effect (via pollution) on others within the society. Economists call this a negative consumption externality. This problem can be corrected with any policy that reduces the negative effect at a cost that is less than the benefit. A tariff on imports is one such policy that could work. However, the most direct policy option, hence the first-best policy choice, is a consumption tax. Below we’ll show the welfare effects of a tariff and a domestic consumption tax and compare the results to demonstrate why a consumption tax is first best while a tariff is second best.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">A Comparison: Trade Policy versus Domestic Policy</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch09_s09_s04_p01">More interesting is the comparison between the welfare effects of a tariff and those of a consumption tax. Since the two policies are set at identical levels, it is easy to compare the effects. The distributional effects—that is, who wins and who loses—are slightly different in the two cases. First, the effects on consumers are the same since both policies raise the price to the same level. However, domestic producers suffer a loss in producer surplus with a tariff, whereas they are unaffected by the consumption tax. To some, this may look like a bad effect since domestic production of the polluting good is not reduced with the consumption tax. However, it is the net effect that matters. Next, the government collects more revenue with the domestic tax than with the tariff since both taxes are set at the same rate and consumption is greater than imports. Finally, the environmental effect is the same for both since consumption is reduced to the same level.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch09_s09_s04_p02">The net welfare effect of the consumption tax (<em class="emphasis">NW</em><sup class="superscript"><em class="emphasis">C</em></sup> = <em class="emphasis">k</em> − <em class="emphasis">f</em>) clearly must exceed the net welfare effect of a tariff (<em class="emphasis">NW</em><sup class="superscript"><em class="emphasis">T</em></sup> = <em class="emphasis">k</em> − <em class="emphasis">d</em> − <em class="emphasis">f</em>)—that is, <em class="emphasis">NW</em><sup class="superscript"><em class="emphasis">C</em></sup> &gt; <em class="emphasis">NW</em><sup class="superscript"><em class="emphasis">T</em></sup>. The reason is that the tariff incurs two separate costs on society to receive the environmental benefit, whereas the consumption tax incurs only one cost for the same benefit. Specifically, the tariff causes a loss in both consumption and production efficiency (<em class="emphasis">d</em> and <em class="emphasis">f</em>), while the consumption tax only causes a consumption efficiency loss (<em class="emphasis">f</em>). For this reason, we say it is more efficient (i.e., less costly) to use a domestic consumption tax to correct for a negative consumption externality such as pollution than to use a trade policy, <em class="emphasis">even though</em> the trade policy may improve national welfare.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">A Source of Controversy</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch09_s09_s04_s01_p01">For many environmental advocates, trade liberalization, or globalization more generally, clearly has the potential to cause environmental damage to many ecosystems. Concerns include pollution from industrial production, pollution from consumption, clear-cutting of tropical forests, extinction of plant and animal species, and global warming, among others. Although only one type of environmental problem is addressed above, the principles of the theory of the second best will generally apply to all these concerns.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch09_s09_s04_s01_p02">The analysis above accepts the possibility that consumption causes pollution and that pollution is bad for society. The model shows that under these assumptions, a trade policy can potentially be used to improve environmental outcomes and can even be in society’s overall interest. However, a trade policy is not the most efficient means to achieve the end. Instead, resources will be better allocated if a domestic policy, such as a consumption tax, is used instead. Since the domestic policy attacks the distortion most directly, it minimizes the economic cost. For this reason, a properly chosen consumption tax will always do better than any tariff.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch09_s09_s04_s01_p03">With respect to other types of environmental problems, a similar conclusion can be reached. The best way to correct for most pollution and other environmental problems will be to use a domestic policy intervention such as a production tax, consumption tax, factor-use tax, or another type of domestic regulation. Trade policies, although potentially beneficial, are not the most efficient policy instruments to use.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch09_s09_s04_s01_p04">It is worth emphasizing that the goal of most economic analysis should in many instances be aligned with the goal of environmentalists. It is the extraction and use of natural resources that contributes to environmental damage. At the same time, it is the extraction and use of natural resources that is necessary to produce the goods and services needed to raise human standards of living to acceptable levels. Thus, if we minimize the use of resources to produce a particular level of output, we can achieve both the economist’s goal of maximizing efficiency and the environmentalist’s goal of minimizing damage to the environment.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch09_s09_s05_p01">In October 1999, the WTO Committee on Trade and Environment, a committee set up during the Uruguay Round to consider the linkages between these two concerns, issued its Trade and Environment report. The report argued that “there is no basis for the sweeping generalizations that are often heard in the public debate, arguing that trade is either good for the environment, or bad for the environment. The real world linkages are a little bit of both.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-surantrade-fn09_006">World Trade Organization, “Trade liberalization reinforces the need for environmental cooperation,” press release, October 8, 1999, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.wto.org/english/news_e/pres99_e/pr140_e.htm">http://www.wto.org/english/news_e/pres99_e/pr140_e.htm</a>.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch09_s09_s05_p02">Some of the main findings of the report are listed here with a brief explanation of how these statements relate to the theory of the second best.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch09_s09_s05_p04">This statement relates to the theory of the second best by highlighting that the root cause of most environmental problems is the production, consumption, and disposal processes rather than trade. The one exception is pollution caused by ships, trucks, trains, and planes transporting goods across borders, but this is a relatively minor source of global pollution. Recall that first-best solutions are those that attack the root cause of a problem most directly.</p>

            <p class="para editable" id="fwk-61960-ch09_s09_s05_p05">Environmental degradation occurs because producers and consumers are not always required to pay for the costs of their actions.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-surantrade-fn09_008">World Trade Organization, “Trade liberalization reinforces the need for environmental cooperation,” press release, October 8, 1999, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.wto.org/english/news_e/pres99_e/pr140_e.htm">http://www.wto.org/english/news_e/pres99_e/pr140_e.htm</a>.</span></p>
        </span>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch09_s09_s05_p06">This statement means that environmental problems are a negative externality in either production or consumption. If producers and consumers had to pay for the environmental effects of their actions, that would mean there is a market for pollution. In a market, the costs and benefits are internalized in the decision-making process. However, in the absence of a market, producer and consumer effects occur “external” to the market, hence the term “externality.”</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch09_s09_s05_p07">However, this statement exaggerates one thing if it suggests that environmental degradation would not occur if consumers and producers were required to pay for their actions. In actuality, if a market for pollution existed, producers and consumers would continue to pollute up to the level where the costs of additional pollution exceeded the benefits. This undoubtedly would occur at some positive level of pollution and environmental degradation. As demonstrated in every environmental economics course, the socially optimal level of pollution is not zero.</p>
        <span class="blockquote block" id="fwk-61960-ch09_s09_s05_bl03">
            <p class="para editable" id="fwk-61960-ch09_s09_s05_p08">Environmental degradation is sometimes accentuated by policy failures, including subsidies to polluting and resource-degrading activities—such as subsidies to agriculture, fishing and energy.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-surantrade-fn09_009">World Trade Organization, “Trade liberalization reinforces the need for environmental cooperation,” press release, October 8, 1999, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.wto.org/english/news_e/pres99_e/pr140_e.htm">http://www.wto.org/english/news_e/pres99_e/pr140_e.htm</a>.</span></p>
        </span>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch09_s09_s05_p09">This statement points out that many environmental problems are made worse by government interventions designed to serve some other purpose. For example, subsidies to agricultural production, designed to support the income of farmers, can have the unintended effect of encouraging the greater use of pesticides and fertilizers, thus causing a negative environmental effect. Again, this suggests that the source of environmental problems is typically not international trade.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch09_s09_s05_p13">Why? Because of the theory of the second best. It is generally better to correct environmental externality problems using first-best domestic taxes, subsidies, or regulations than to use second-best trade policies. Thus, although trade policies <em class="emphasis">can</em> have favorable environmental effects, governments can achieve the same results more efficiently—that is, at a lower resource cost—by using domestic policies instead.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch09_s09_s05_p14">This is one of the strongest arguments for excluding an explicit link between environment and trade in the WTO accords and more generally in free trade area agreements. Linking the two together in a trade agreement will surely lead to the avoidance of trade liberalization in some sectors in order to secure a favorable environmental outcome, and this will mean using trade barriers as a tool for environmental policy.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch09_s09_s05_p15">So what can or should be done? First, it is important to recognize that the WTO agreement does not prohibit countries from setting their own environmental standards. What the WTO accord does require is that countries apply most-favored nation (MFN) and national treatment in their application of environmental laws. For example, the WTO agreement does not allow a country to set one environmental standard with respect to goods imported from Argentina and another for goods from Mexico. This would violate MFN. Also, the WTO agreement would not allow a country to treat imported goods differently from goods produced at home. This would violate national treatment.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch09_s09_s05_p16">In fact, most of the WTO dispute settlement rulings (if not all) identified by environmental groups as forcing countries to change (and make more lenient) their environmental laws were not decisions to force a particular environmental standard on countries. Instead, they were decisions to enforce MFN or national treatment. Countries could have complied with any of these rulings by strengthening environmental regulations just as long as they did not discriminate internationally in their application.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch09_s09_s05_p17">Lastly, countries are not prohibited by the WTO agreement from negotiating and implementing international environmental agreements. A prime example is the Kyoto Protocol. This agreement would require signatory countries to reduce their domestic carbon emissions to agreed-on levels within a specified period of time in order to mitigate an important source of global warming. The mechanism used to reduce emissions in this case would be purely domestic policies implemented simultaneously by all signatory countries. As such, this would more likely be a first-best method to correct for global warming and would dominate any type of trade policy to solve the same problem.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">One Final Issue: Measurement Problems</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch09_s09_s06_p01">In the previous analysis, we assumed the environmental costs of consumption are measurable in dollar terms. However, obtaining these costs is not a simple exercise since there is no market in which pollution is traded. It may be relatively easy to measure the average amount of pollutants (carbon dioxide, sulfur, etc.) caused by each gallon of gasoline consumed, but translating that into a dollar equivalent is not a simple task. Ideally, we would want to know how much people would be willing to pay to prevent the pollution caused by each gallon of consumed gasoline. Environmental economists have tried to measure these types of costs using “contingent valuation” techniques. However, these methods are still in their infancy in terms of providing an accurate and believable measure of environmental cost.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch09_s09_s06_p02">Without good information concerning environmental costs, it becomes almost impossible to set policies appropriately. Although welfare-improving tariffs and domestic policies can raise national welfare, they must be set at correct levels to achieve a welfare-enhancing effect. To obtain the optimal levels requires accurate information about both the economic costs and the benefits of price changes and the environmental effects as well. Without good information, it becomes more likely policies will not achieve the intended effect.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch09_s09_s06_p03">An alternative method to measure costs is for the government to require permits that allow one to pollute. If these permits were tradable, the market price of a permit would provide a reasonable estimate of the pollution cost to society. In essence, this creates a market for pollution. These programs have been applied to control industrial pollutants but have not been used in consumer markets. In addition, to most noneconomists, providing permits that allow pollution seems anathema. However, because these programs attempt to correct for problems related to the measurement of environmental costs, they may be even more efficient even than using domestic taxes.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch09_s09_s06_p04">In the end, we must recognize that our theoretical analysis can only suggest the possibility that trade liberalization will make a country worse off due to increases in pollution. The model shows that this is logically possible. However, the model also shows it is logically possible for trade liberalization to raise national welfare despite increases in pollution. It then becomes an empirical question of what the effect of trade liberalization will be. For this reason, many environmental groups, such as Sierra Club, have proposed that an environmental impact statement (EIS) be prepared for every trade agreement. An EIS would assess the environmental costs of the agreement and thereby make environmental concerns a criterion in the decision process. Presumably, these studies could prevent environmentally unfriendly trade agreements from being ratified.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch09_s09_s06_p05">Many proponents of freer trade have objected to this proposal. Jagdish Bhagwati, for one, in his book <em class="emphasis">In Defense of Globalization</em>, suggests that the ability to measure the environmental costs may be as difficult as, or perhaps more difficult than, measuring the economic effects of a trade agreement.</p>

            <ul class="itemizedlist" id="fwk-61960-ch09_s09_s06_l01">
                <li>Environmental problems generally correspond to negative production or consumption externalities. Thus these issues represent market imperfections.</li>
                <li>This section presents a model in which domestic consumption of an import good causes environmental pollution (e.g., gasoline consumption). This is the case of a negative consumption externality.</li>
                <li>The model is used to show that trade liberalization may cause a reduction in national welfare if the additional pollution caused by increased consumption is greater than the efficiency benefits that arise from freer trade. Thus concerns that trade liberalization may cause environmental damage are consistent with economic theory.</li>
                <li>However, the theory of the second best suggests that when market imperfections exist, trade policy corrections may be second-best, not first-best, policy choices.</li>
                <li>Both an import tariff and a domestic consumption tax will reduce domestic consumption of the import good and lead to a reduction in pollution. However, the domestic consumption tax achieves the result at a lower economic cost than the import tariff. Thus we say that the domestic consumption tax is a first-best policy, while the import tariff is a second-best policy.</li>
                <li>The previous result corresponds to the general theory of the second best, which says that the first-best policy will be the policy that targets a distortion or imperfection most directly. In most cases, a domestic policy will be better than a trade policy. In this example, a domestic consumption tax is clearly superior to a trade policy.</li>

<span class="title-prefix">Chapter 2</span> The Ricardian Theory of Comparative Advantage</h1>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch02_p01">This chapter presents the first formal model of international trade: the Ricardian model. It is one of the simplest models, and still, by introducing the principle of comparative advantage, it offers some of the most compelling reasons supporting international trade. Readers will learn some of the surprising outcomes of the Ricardian model; for example, less productive nations can benefit from free trade with their more productive neighbors, and very low-wage countries are unlikely to be able to use their production cost advantage in many circumstances. Readers will also learn why so many people, even those who have studied the Ricardian theory, consistently get the results wrong.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch02_p02">In other words, the Ricardian model is both one of the most misunderstood and one of the most compelling models of international trade.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch02_s01_s01_p01">Advantageous trade can occur between countries if the countries differ in their technological abilities to produce goods and services.

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch02_s01_s02_p01">Advantageous trade can occur between countries if the countries differ in their endowments of resources. Resource endowments refer to the skills and abilities of a country’s workforce, the natural resources available within its borders (minerals, farmland, etc.), and the sophistication of its capital stock (machinery, infrastructure, communications systems).

        <h2 class="title editable block">Reason for Trade #3: Differences in Demand</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch02_s01_s03_p01">Advantageous trade can occur between countries if demands or preferences differ between countries. Individuals in different countries may have different preferences or demands for various products. For example, the Chinese are likely to demand more rice than Americans, even if consumers face the same price. Canadians may demand more beer, the Dutch more wooden shoes, and the Japanese more fish than Americans would, even if they all faced the same prices. There is no formal trade model with demand differences, although the monopolistic competition model in <a class="xref" href="fwk-61960-ch06#fwk-61960-ch06">Chapter 6 "Economies of Scale and International Trade"</a> does include a demand for variety that can be based on differences in tastes between consumers.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch02_s01_s04_p01">The existence of economies of scale in production is sufficient to generate advantageous trade between two countries. Economies of scale refer to a production process in which production costs fall as the scale of production rises. This feature of production is also known as “increasing returns to scale.” Two models of trade incorporating economies of scale are presented in <a class="xref" href="fwk-61960-ch06#fwk-61960-ch06">Chapter 6 "Economies of Scale and International Trade"</a>.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Reason for Trade #5: Existence of Government Policies</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch02_s01_s05_p01">Government tax and subsidy programs alter the prices charged for goods and services. These changes can be sufficient to generate advantages in production of certain products. In these circumstances, advantageous trade may arise solely due to differences in government policies across countries. <a class="xref" href="fwk-61960-ch08#fwk-61960-ch08">Chapter 8 "Domestic Policies and International Trade"</a>, <a class="xref" href="fwk-61960-ch08_s03#fwk-61960-ch08_s03">Section 8.3 "Production Subsidies as a Reason for Trade"</a> and <a class="xref" href="fwk-61960-ch08#fwk-61960-ch08">Chapter 8 "Domestic Policies and International Trade"</a>, <a class="xref" href="fwk-61960-ch08_s06#fwk-61960-ch08_s06">Section 8.6 "Consumption Taxes as a Reason for Trade"</a> provide several examples in which domestic tax or subsidy policies can induce international trade.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Summary</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch02_s01_s06_p01">There are very few models of trade that include all five reasons for trade simultaneously. The reason is that such a model is too complicated to work with. Economists simplify the world by choosing a model that generally contains just one reason. This does not mean that economists believe that one reason, or one model, is sufficient to explain all outcomes. Instead, one must try to understand the world by looking at what a collection of different models tells us about the same phenomenon.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch02_s01_s06_p02">For example, the Ricardian model of trade, which incorporates differences in technologies between countries, concludes that everyone benefits from trade, whereas the Heckscher-Ohlin model, which incorporates endowment differences, concludes that there will be winners and losers from trade. Change the basis for trade and you may change the outcomes from trade.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch02_s01_s06_p03">In the real world, trade takes place because of a combination of all these different reasons. Each single model provides only a glimpse of some of the effects that might arise. Consequently, we should expect that a combination of the different outcomes that are presented in different models is the true characterization of the real world. Unfortunately, because of this, understanding the complexities of the real world is still more of an art than a science.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Historical Overview</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch02_s02_s01_p01">The theory of <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">comparative advantage</a><span class="glossdef">A country has a comparative advantage when it can produce a good at a lower opportunity cost than another country; alternatively, when the relative productivities between goods compared with another country are the highest.</span></span> is perhaps the most important concept in international trade theory. It is also one of the most commonly misunderstood principles. There is a popular story told among economists that once when an economics skeptic asked Paul Samuelson (a Nobel laureate in economics) to provide a meaningful and nontrivial result from the economics discipline, Samuelson quickly responded, “comparative advantage.”</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch02_s02_s01_p02">The sources of the misunderstandings are easy to identify. First, the principle of comparative advantage is clearly counterintuitive. Many results from the formal model are contrary to simple logic. Second, it is easy to confuse the theory with another notion about advantageous trade, known in trade theory as the theory of absolute advantage. The logic behind absolute advantage <em class="emphasis">is</em> quite intuitive. This confusion between these two concepts leads many people to think that they understand comparative advantage when in fact what they understand is absolute advantage. Finally, the theory of comparative advantage is all too often presented only in its mathematical form. Numerical examples or diagrammatic representations are extremely useful in demonstrating the basic results and the deeper implications of the theory. However, it is also easy to <em class="emphasis">see</em> the results mathematically without ever understanding the basic intuition of the theory.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch02_s02_s01_p03">The early logic that free trade could be advantageous for countries was based on the concept of absolute advantages in production. Adam Smith wrote in <em class="emphasis">The Wealth of Nations</em>, “If a foreign country can supply us with a commodity cheaper than we ourselves can make it, better buy it of them with some part of the produce of our own industry, employed in a way in which we have some advantage” (Book IV, Section ii, 12).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-surantrade-fn02_001">For more information, see Rod Hay, “Adam Smith,” McMaster University Archive for the History of Economic Thought, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://socserv.mcmaster.ca/econ/ugcm/3ll3/smith/wealth/index.html">http://socserv.mcmaster.ca/econ/ugcm/3ll3/smith/wealth/index.html</a>.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch02_s02_s01_p04">The idea here is simple and intuitive. If our country can produce some set of goods at a lower cost than a foreign country and if the foreign country can produce some other set of goods at a lower cost than we can produce them, then clearly it would be best for us to trade our relatively cheaper goods for their relatively cheaper goods. In this way, both countries may gain from trade.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch02_s02_s01_p05">The original idea of comparative advantage dates to the early part of the nineteenth century.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-surantrade-fn02_002">For a more complete history of these ideas, see Douglas A. Irwin, <em class="emphasis">Against the Tide: An Intellectual History of Free Trade</em> (Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1996).</span> Although the model describing the theory is commonly referred to as the “Ricardian model,” the original description of the idea (see <a class="xref" href="fwk-61960-ch02#fwk-61960-ch02">Chapter 2 "The Ricardian Theory of Comparative Advantage"</a>, <a class="xref" href="fwk-61960-ch02_s12#fwk-61960-ch02_s12">Section 2.12 "Appendix: Robert Torrens on Comparative Advantage"</a>) can be found in the 1815 <em class="emphasis">Essay on the External Corn Trade</em><span class="footnote" id="fwk-surantrade-fn02_003">See Robert Torrens, <em class="emphasis">Essay on the External Corn Trade</em> (London: J. Hatchard, 1815).</span> by Robert Torrens. David Ricardo formalized the idea using a compelling yet simple numerical example in his 1817 book <em class="emphasis">On the Principles of Political Economy and Taxation</em>.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-surantrade-fn02_004">See David Ricardo, <em class="emphasis">On the Principles of Political Economy and Taxation</em>, McMaster University Archive for the History of Economic Thought, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://socserv2.socsci.mcmaster.ca/~econ/ugcm/3ll3/ricardo/prin/index.html">http://socserv2.socsci.mcmaster.ca/ ~econ/ugcm/3ll3/ricardo/prin/index.html</a>.</span> The idea appeared again in James Mill’s 1821 <em class="emphasis">Elements of Political Economy</em>.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-surantrade-fn02_005">See James Mill, <em class="emphasis">Elements of Political Economy</em> (London: Baldwin, Cradock &amp; Joy, 1821).</span> Finally, the concept became a key feature of international political economy upon the 1848 publication of <em class="emphasis">Principles of Political Economy</em> by John Stuart Mill.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-surantrade-fn02_006">See John Stuart Mill, <em class="emphasis">Principles of Political Economy</em>, McMaster University Archive for the History of Economic Thought, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://socserv2.socsci.mcmaster.ca/~econ/ugcm/3ll3/mill/index.html">http://socserv2.socsci.mcmaster.ca/~econ/ugcm/3ll3/mill/index.html</a>.</span></p>

    <div class="section" id="fwk-61960-ch02_s02_s02">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Ricardo’s Numerical Example</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch02_s02_s02_p01">Because the idea of comparative advantage is not immediately intuitive, the best way of presenting it seems to be with an explicit numerical example as provided by Ricardo. Indeed, some variation of Ricardo’s example lives on in most international trade textbooks today.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch02_s02_s02_p02">In his example, Ricardo imagined two countries, England and Portugal, producing two goods, cloth and wine, using labor as the sole input in production. He assumed that the productivity of labor (i.e., the quantity of output produced per worker) varied between industries and across countries. However, instead of assuming, as Adam Smith did, that England is more productive in producing one good and Portugal is more productive in the other, Ricardo assumed that Portugal was more productive in both goods. Based on Smith’s intuition, then, it would seem that trade could not be advantageous, at least for England.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch02_s02_s02_p03">However, Ricardo demonstrated numerically that if England specialized in producing one of the two goods and if Portugal produced the other, then total world output of both goods could rise! If an appropriate <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">terms of trade</a><span class="glossdef">The amount of one good traded per unit of another in a mutually voluntary exchange. Often expressed as a ratio of prices and measured as a ratio of units; for example, pounds of cheese per gallon of wine.</span></span> (i.e., amount of one good traded for another) were then chosen, both countries could end up with more of both goods after specialization and free trade than they each had before trade. This means that England may nevertheless benefit from free trade even though it is assumed to be technologically inferior to Portugal in the production of everything.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch02_s02_s02_p04">As it turned out, specialization in <em class="emphasis">any</em> good would not suffice to guarantee the improvement in world output. Only one of the goods would work. Ricardo showed that the specialization good in each country should be that good in which the country had a comparative advantage in production. To identify a country’s comparative advantage good requires a comparison of production costs across countries. However, one does not compare the monetary costs of production or even the resource costs (labor needed per unit of output) of production. Instead, one must compare the <em class="emphasis">opportunity</em> costs of producing goods across countries.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch02_s02_s02_p05">A country is said to have a comparative advantage in the production of a good (say, cloth) if it can produce it at a lower opportunity cost than another country. The opportunity cost of cloth production is defined as the amount of wine that must be given up in order to produce one more unit of cloth. Thus England would have the comparative advantage in cloth production relative to Portugal if it must give up less wine to produce another unit of cloth than the amount of wine that Portugal would have to give up to produce another unit of cloth.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch02_s02_s02_p06">All in all, this condition is rather confusing. Suffice it to say that it is quite possible, indeed likely, that although England may be less productive in producing both goods relative to Portugal, it will nonetheless have a comparative advantage in the production of one of the two goods. Indeed, there is only one circumstance in which England would not have a comparative advantage in either good, and in this case Portugal also would not have a comparative advantage in either good. In other words, either each country has the comparative advantage in one of the two goods or neither country has a comparative advantage in anything.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch02_s02_s02_p07">Another way to define comparative advantage is by comparing productivities across industries and countries. Suppose, as before, that Portugal is more productive than England in the production of both cloth and wine. If Portugal is twice as productive in cloth production relative to England but three times as productive in wine, then Portugal’s comparative advantage is in wine, the good in which its productivity advantage is greatest. Similarly, England’s comparative advantage good is cloth, the good in which its productivity disadvantage is least. This implies that to benefit from specialization and free trade, Portugal should specialize in and trade the good that it is “most better” at producing, while England should specialize in and trade the good that it is “least worse” at producing.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch02_s02_s02_p08">Note that trade based on comparative advantage does not contradict Adam Smith’s notion of advantageous trade based on absolute advantage. If, as in Smith’s example, England were more productive in cloth production and Portugal were more productive in wine, then we would say that England has an absolute advantage in cloth production, while Portugal has an absolute advantage in wine. If we calculated comparative advantages, then England would also have the comparative advantage in cloth and Portugal would have the comparative advantage in wine. In this case, gains from trade could be realized if both countries specialized in their comparative and absolute advantage goods. Advantageous trade based on comparative advantage, then, covers a larger set of circumstances while still including the case of absolute advantage and hence is a more general theory.</p>

    <div class="section" id="fwk-61960-ch02_s02_s03">
        <h2 class="title editable block">The Ricardian Model: Assumptions and Results</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch02_s02_s03_p01">The modern version of the Ricardian model and its results is typically presented by constructing and analyzing an economic model of an international economy. In its most simple form, the model assumes two countries producing two goods using labor as the only factor of production. Goods are assumed to be <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">homogeneous</a><span class="glossdef">Goods, or production factors, that are identical and thus perfectly substitutable in consumption, or production.</span></span> (i.e., identical) across firms and countries. Labor is homogeneous within a country but heterogeneous (nonidentical) across countries. Goods can be transported costlessly between countries. Labor can be reallocated costlessly between industries within a country but cannot move between countries. Labor is always fully employed. Production technology differences exist across industries and across countries and are reflected in labor productivity parameters. The labor and goods markets are assumed to be perfectly competitive in both countries. Firms are assumed to maximize profit, while consumers (workers) are assumed to maximize utility.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch02_s02_s03_p02">The primary issue in the analysis of this model is what happens when each country moves from <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">autarky</a><span class="glossdef">The situation in which a country does not trade with the rest of the world.</span></span> (no trade) to free trade with the other country—in other words, what are the effects of trade? The main things we care about are trade’s effects on the prices of the goods in each country, the production levels of the goods, employment levels in each industry, the pattern of trade (who exports and who imports what), consumption levels in each country, wages and incomes, and the welfare effects both nationally and individually.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch02_s02_s03_p03">Using the model, one can show that in autarky each country will produce some of each good. Because of the technology differences, relative prices of the two goods will differ between countries. The price of each country’s comparative advantage good will be lower than the price of the same good in the other country. If one country has an absolute advantage in the production of both goods (as assumed by Ricardo), then real wages of workers (i.e., the purchasing power of wages) in that country will be higher in both industries compared to wages in the other country. In other words, workers in the technologically advanced country would enjoy a higher standard of living than in the technologically inferior country. The reason for this is that wages are based on productivity; thus in the country that is more productive, workers get higher wages.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch02_s02_s03_p04">The next step in the analysis is to assume that trade between countries is suddenly liberalized and made free. The initial differences in relative prices of the goods between countries in autarky will stimulate trade between the countries. Since the differences in prices arise directly out of differences in technology between countries, it is the differences in technology that cause trade in the model. Profit-seeking firms in each country’s comparative advantage industry would recognize that the price of their good is higher in the other country. Since transportation costs are zero, more profit can be made through export than with sales domestically. Thus each country would export the good in which it has a comparative advantage. Trade flows would increase until the price of each good is equal across countries. In the end, the price of each country’s export good (its comparative advantage good) will rise and the price of its import good (its comparative disadvantage good) will fall.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch02_s02_s03_p05">The higher price received for each country’s comparative advantage good would lead each country to specialize in that good. To accomplish this, labor would have to move from the comparative disadvantage industry into the comparative advantage industry. This means that one industry goes out of business in each country. However, because the model assumes full employment and costless mobility of labor, all these workers are immediately gainfully employed in the other industry.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch02_s02_s03_p06">One striking result here is that even when one country is technologically superior to the other in both industries, one of these industries would go out of business when opening to free trade. Thus technological superiority is not enough to guarantee continued production of a good in free trade. A country must have a comparative advantage in production of a good rather than an absolute advantage to guarantee continued production in free trade. From the perspective of a less-developed country, <em class="emphasis">the developed country’s superior technology need not imply that less-developed country (LDC) industries cannot compete in international markets</em>.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch02_s02_s03_p07">Another striking result is that the technologically superior country’s comparative advantage industry survives while the same industry disappears in the other country, even though the workers in the other country’s industry have lower wages. In other words, low wages in another country in a particular industry is not sufficient information to determine which country’s industry would perish under free trade. From the perspective of a developed country, <em class="emphasis">freer trade may not result in a domestic industry’s decline just because the foreign firms pay their workers lower wages</em>.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch02_s02_s03_p08">The movement to free trade generates an improvement in welfare in both countries individually and nationally. Specialization and trade will increase the set of consumption possibilities, compared with autarky, and will make possible an increase in consumption of both goods nationally. These aggregate gains are often described as improvements in production and consumption efficiency. Free trade raises aggregate world production efficiency because more of both goods are likely to be produced with the same number of workers. Free trade also improves aggregate consumption efficiency, which implies that consumers have a more pleasing set of choices and prices available to them.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch02_s02_s03_p09">Real wages (and incomes) of individual workers are also shown to rise in both countries. Thus every worker can consume more of both goods in free trade compared with autarky. In short, everybody benefits from free trade in both countries. In the Ricardian model, trade is truly a win-win situation.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Defending against Skeptics: The Intuition behind the Theory of Comparative Advantage</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch02_s02_s04_p01">Many people who learn about the theory of comparative advantage quickly convince themselves that its ability to describe the real world is extremely limited, if not nonexistent. Although the results follow logically from the assumptions, the assumptions are easily assailed as unrealistic. For example, the model assumes only two countries producing two goods using just one factor of production. No capital or land or other resources are needed for production. The real world, on the other hand, consists of many countries producing many goods using many factors of production. In the model, each market is assumed to be perfectly competitive when in reality there are many industries in which firms have market power. Labor productivity is assumed to be fixed when in actuality it changes over time, perhaps based on past production levels. Full employment is assumed when clearly workers cannot immediately and costlessly move to other industries. Also, all workers are assumed to be identical. This means that when a worker is moved from one industry to another, he or she is immediately as productive as every other worker who was previously employed there. Finally, the model assumes that technology differences are the only differences that exist between the countries.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch02_s02_s04_p02">With so many unrealistic assumptions, it is difficult for some people to accept the conclusions of the model with any confidence, especially when so many of the results are counterintuitive. Indeed, one of the most difficult aspects of economic analysis is how to interpret the conclusions of models. Models are, by their nature, simplifications of the real world and thus all economic models contain unrealistic assumptions. Therefore, to dismiss the results of economic analysis on the basis of unrealistic assumptions means that one must dismiss all insights contained within the entire economics discipline. Surely, this is neither practical nor realistic. Economic models in general and the Ricardian model in particular do contain insights that most likely carry over to the more complex real world. The following story is meant to explain some of the insights within the theory of comparative advantage by placing the model into a more familiar setting.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch02_s02_s04_s01_p01">Suppose it is early spring and it is time to prepare the family backyard garden for the first planting of the year. The father in the household sets aside one Sunday afternoon to do the job but hopes to complete the job as quickly as possible. Preparation of the garden requires the following tasks. First, the soil must be turned over and broken up using the rototiller. Then the soil must be raked and smoothed. Finally, seeds must be planted, or sowed.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch02_s02_s04_s01_p02">This year, the father’s seven-year-old son is anxious to help.

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch02_s02_s04_s01_p03">At first thought, the father is reluctant to accept help. Clearly each task would take the father less time to complete than it would take the son. In other words, the father can perform each task more efficiently than the seven-year-old son. The father estimates that it will take him three hours to prepare the garden if he works alone, as shown in <a class="xref" href="#fwk-61960-ch02_s02_s04_s01_t01">Table 2.1 "Father’s Task Times without Son"</a>.</p>

First, the father begins the rototilling. Once he has completed half of the garden, the son begins raking the rototilled section while the father finishes rototilling the rest of the garden plot. After the father finishes rototilling, he begins planting seeds in the section the son has already raked. Suppose that the son rakes slower than the father plants and that the father completes the sowing process just as the son finishes raking. Note this implies that raking takes the son almost two hours compared to one hour for the father. However, because the son’s work and the father’s work are done simultaneously, it does not add to the total time for the project. Under this plan, the time needed to complete the tasks is shown in <a class="xref" href="#fwk-61960-ch02_s02_s04_s01_t02">Table 2.2 "Father’s Task Times with Son"</a>.</p>

The garden is prepared in less time with the son’s help than it could have been done independently by the father. In other words, it makes sense to employ the son in (garden) production even though the son is less efficient than the dad in every one of the three required tasks. Overall efficiency is enhanced when both resources (the father and son) are fully employed.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch02_s02_s04_s01_p06">This arrangement also clearly benefits both the father and son. The father completes the task in less time and thus winds up with some additional leisure time that the father and son can enjoy together. The son also benefits because he has contributed his skills to a productive activity and will enjoy a sense of accomplishment. Thus both parties benefit from the arrangement.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch02_s02_s04_s01_p09">This highlights the importance of specializing in production of the task in which you have a comparative advantage. Even though the father can complete all three tasks quicker than his son, his relative advantage in rototilling greatly exceeds his advantage in raking and planting. One might say that the father is “most better” at rototilling, while he is “least better” at raking and planting. On the other hand, the son is “least worse” at raking and planting but “most worse” at rototilling. Finally, because of the sequential nature of the tasks, the son can remain fully employed only if he works on the middle task, namely, raking.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch02_s03_p01">The Ricardian model shows the possibility that an industry in a developed country could compete against an industry in a less-developed country (LDC) even though the LDC industry pays its workers much lower wages.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch02_s03_p02">The modern version of the Ricardian model assumes that there are two countries producing two goods using one factor of production, usually labor. The model is a general equilibrium model in which all markets (i.e., goods and factors) are perfectly competitive. The goods produced are assumed to be homogeneous across countries and firms within an industry. Goods can be costlessly shipped between countries (i.e., there are no transportation costs). Labor is homogeneous within a country but may have different productivities across countries. This implies that the production technology is assumed to differ across countries. Labor is costlessly mobile across industries within a country but is immobile across countries. Full employment of labor is also assumed. Consumers (the laborers) are assumed to maximize utility subject to an income constraint.</p>

            <li>Output is homogeneous across all firms. This means that goods are identical in all their characteristics such that a consumer would find products from different firms indistinguishable. We could also say that goods from different firms are perfect substitutes for all consumers.</li>
            <li>There is free entry and exit of firms in response to profits. Positive profit sends a signal to the rest of the economy and new firms enter the industry. Negative profit (losses) leads existing firms to exit, one by one, out of the industry. As a result, in the long run economic profit is driven to zero in the industry.</li>
            <li>Information is perfect. For example, all firms have the necessary information to maximize profit and to identify the positive profit and negative profit industries.</li>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch02_s03_s05_p01">In David Ricardo’s original presentation of the model, he focused exclusively on the supply side. Only later did John Stuart Mill introduce demand into the model. Since much can be learned with Ricardo’s incomplete model, we proceed initially without formally specifying demand or utility functions. Later in the chapter we will use the aggregate utility specification to depict an equilibrium in the model.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch02_s03_s05_p02">When needed, we will assume that aggregate utility can be represented by a function of the form <em class="emphasis">U</em> = <em class="emphasis">C</em><sub class="subscript"><em class="emphasis">C</em></sub><em class="emphasis">C</em><sub class="subscript"><em class="emphasis">W</em></sub>, where <em class="emphasis">C</em><sub class="subscript"><em class="emphasis">C</em></sub> and <em class="emphasis">C</em><sub class="subscript"><em class="emphasis">W</em></sub> are the aggregate quantities of cheese and wine consumed in the country, respectively. This function is chosen because it has properties that make it easy to depict an equilibrium. The most important feature is that the function is homothetic, which implies that the country consumes wine and cheese in the same fixed proportion at given prices regardless of income. If two countries share the same homothetic preferences, then when the countries share the same prices, as they will in free trade, they will also consume wine and cheese in the same proportion.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch02_s03_s06_p01">The Ricardian model is a general equilibrium model. This means that it describes a complete circular flow of money in exchange for goods and services. Thus the sale of goods and services generates revenue to the firms that in turn is used to pay for the factor services (wages to workers in this case) used in production. The factor income (wages) is used, in turn, to buy the goods and services produced by the firms. This generates revenue to the firms and the cycle repeats again. A “general equilibrium” arises when prices of goods, services, and factors are such as to equalize supply and demand in all markets simultaneously.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch02_s05_p01">The basis for trade in the Ricardian model is differences in technology between countries. Below we define two different ways to describe technology differences. The first method, called absolute advantage, is the way most people understand technology differences. The second method, called comparative advantage, is a much more difficult concept. As a result, even those who learn about comparative advantage often will confuse it with absolute advantage. It is quite common to see misapplications of the principle of comparative advantage in newspaper and journal stories about trade. Many times authors write “comparative advantage” when in actuality they are describing absolute advantage. This misconception often leads to erroneous implications, such as a fear that technology advances in other countries will cause our country to lose its comparative advantage in everything. As will be shown, this is essentially impossible.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch02_s05_p02">To define absolute advantage, it is useful to define labor productivity first. To define comparative advantage, it is useful to first define opportunity cost. Next, each of these is defined formally using the notation of the Ricardian model.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch02_s05_s04_s02_p01">Another way to describe comparative advantage is to look at the relative productivity advantages of a country. In the United States, the labor productivity in cheese is 1/10, while in France it is 1/20. This means that the U.S. productivity advantage in cheese is (1/10)/(1/20) = 2/1. Thus the United States is twice as productive as France in cheese production. In wine production, the U.S. advantage is (1/2)/(1/5) = (2.5)/1. This means the United States is two and one-half times as productive as France in wine production.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch02_s05_s04_s02_p02">The comparative advantage good in the United States, then, is that good in which the United States enjoys the greatest productivity advantage: wine.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch02_s05_s04_s02_p03">Also consider France’s perspective. Since the United States is two times as productive as France in cheese production, then France must be 1/2 times as productive as the United States in cheese. Similarly, France is 2/5 times as productive in wine as the United States. Since 1/2 &gt; 2/5, France has a disadvantage in production of both goods. However, France’s disadvantage is smallest in cheese; therefore, France has a comparative advantage in cheese.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch02_s06_p01">The simplest way to demonstrate that countries can gain from trade in the Ricardian model is by use of a numerical example. This is how Ricardo presented his argument originally. The example demonstrates that both countries will gain from trade if they specialize in their comparative advantage good and trade some of it for the other good. We set up the example so that one country (the United States) has an absolute advantage in the production of both goods. Ricardo’s surprising result was that a country can gain from trade even if it is technologically inferior in producing every good. Adam Smith explained in <em class="emphasis">The Wealth of Nations</em> that trade is advantageous to both countries, but in his example each country had an absolute advantage in one of the goods. That trade could be advantageous if each country specializes in the good in which it has the technological edge is not surprising at all.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch02_s06_s01_p05">At this point, we can already see a remarkable result. When countries specialize in their comparative advantage good, world output of both wine and cheese rises. Cheese output rises from nineteen to twenty-four pounds. Wine output rises from six to eight gallons. What’s more, the output increases occur without an increase in the quantity of labor used to produce them. In autarky, it took forty-eight worker hours to produce nineteen pounds of cheese and six gallons of wine. With specialization, the same forty-eight worker hours produce twenty-four pounds of cheese and eight gallons of wine. This means that there is an increase in world productivity—more output per unit of labor. Often this productivity improvement is referred to as an increase or improvement in world production efficiency.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch02_s06_s01_p06">The increase in world production efficiency does not benefit the countries unless they can trade with each other after specialization. Both production points were feasible under autarky, but the countries demanded some of each good. Thus the countries will want some of each good after specialization, and the only way to accomplish this is through trade. Now if the world can produce more of both goods through specialization, clearly there must be a way to divide the surplus between the two countries so that each country ends up with more of both goods after trade than it had in autarky.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch02_s06_s01_p07">The surplus in world production amounts to five extra pounds of cheese and two extra gallons of wine. To assure that trade is advantageous for the two countries, each must have at least as much to consume of one good and more to consume of the other. Suppose we split the wine surplus equally and give three extra pounds of cheese to France and two extra pounds to the United States. Since the United States consumed sixteen pounds of cheese and four gallons of wine in autarky, it would now have eighteen pounds of cheese and five gallons of wine after specialization and trade. France, which began with three pounds of cheese and two gallons of wine in autarky, would now have six pounds of cheese and three gallons of wine. Consumption and production after trade for the two countries is shown in <a class="xref" href="#fwk-61960-ch02_s06_s01_t02">Table 2.10 "Consumption and Production after Trade"</a>.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch02_s06_s01_p08">In order for consumption of both goods to be higher in both countries, trade must occur. In the example, the United States is consuming five gallons of wine and producing none, so it must import the five gallons from France. France is consuming six pounds of cheese with no cheese production, so it must import the six pounds from the United States. The terms of trade is TOT = 5 gals./6 lbs., or 5/6 gals./lb.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Exercise Conclusion</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch02_s06_s02_p01">The Ricardian model numerical example assumes that countries differ in their production technologies such that one of the countries is absolutely more productive than the other in the production of each of the two goods. If these two countries specialize in their comparative advantage good, then world production rises for both goods. Increased output occurs even though there is no increase in the amount of labor input in the world; thus the example demonstrates that specialization can raise world production efficiency. Because of the increase in output, it is possible to construct a terms of trade between the countries such that each country consumes more of each good with specialization and trade than was possible under autarky. Thus both countries can gain from trade. The surprising result of this example is that a country that is technologically inferior to another in the production of all goods can nevertheless benefit from trade with that country.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Limitations of the Numerical Example</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch02_s06_s03_p01">A numerical example can display only one possible outcome for the model. As such, all conclusions should be viewed as possibilities rather than general results of the model. With further thought, there are some problems with the example. First, it is conceivable that with a different choice for the country’s autarky production and consumption points, world output might not rise for both goods upon specialization. In this case, we could not be sure that both countries would gain from trade. Second, since we merely made up a terms of trade that generated the interesting conclusion, we could ask whether a favorable terms of trade is likely to arise. Is it possible to make up a different terms of trade such that one country enjoys all the benefits of increased production while the other is made worse off? How can we be sure that this outcome would not arise? Finally, even if the country has more of both goods after trade, can we be sure that all consumers would have more of both goods? Perhaps some consumers would have more and others less.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch02_s06_s03_p02">The answer to some of these questions can be found by describing more carefully some of the features of the model. In particular, we must describe the relationship between prices and wages. Using these relationships, we can explain the impact of free trade on the price ratio and the effect of trade on the distribution of income.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch02_s07_p01">The Ricardian model assumes that the wine and cheese industries are both perfectly competitive. Among the assumptions of perfect competition is free entry and exit of firms in response to economic profit. If positive profits are being made in one industry, then because of perfect information, profit-seeking entrepreneurs will begin to open more firms in that industry. The entry of firms, however, raises industry supply, which forces down the product price and reduces profit for every other firm in the industry. Entry continues until economic profit is driven to zero. The same process occurs in reverse when profit is negative for firms in an industry. In this case, firms will close down one by one as they seek more profitable opportunities elsewhere. The reduction in the number of firms reduces industry supply, which raises the product’s market price and raises profit for all remaining firms in the industry. Exit continues until economic profit is raised to zero. This implies that if production occurs in an industry, be it in autarky or free trade, then economic profit must be zero.</p>

Another way to say the same thing is that the price of cheese (in terms of wine) in autarky equals the opportunity cost of producing cheese (in terms of wine).</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch02_s08_p07"><strong class="emphasis bold">Question</strong>: Why is there an autarky terms of trade when there is no trade in autarky?</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch02_s08_p08"><strong class="emphasis bold">Answer</strong>: The Ricardian model represents a barter economy. Even though we define prices and wages in monetary terms, all relevant solutions in the model are described in terms of ratios in which the money or dollars cancel out. Never will we solve explicitly for the dollar price of wine or cheese or the dollar wage rate.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch02_s08_p09">Thus a good way to think about how the model works is to imagine that workers go to work in their respective industries and produce wine or cheese. At the end of the day, they are paid not in dollars but in goods. The cheese workers’ wage is a quantity of cheese. The wine workers earn a quantity of wine. Since workers, as consumers, presumably will desire some wine and some cheese for their evening dinner, they must first go to a market to trade some of their wages (goods) for some of the other goods available at the market.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch02_s08_p10">In autarky, cheese workers and wine workers come together on the domestic market to trade their goods. The autarky price ratio or terms of trade represents the amount of wine that exchanges per unit of cheese on the domestic barter market.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch02_s09_p01">The Ricardian model can be used to explain Adam Smith’s <em class="emphasis">invisible hand</em>. The invisible hand refers to the ability of the market, or the market mechanism, to allocate resources to their best possible uses. In the presentation of the Ricardian model it seems as if one must apply a mathematical formula (comparing opportunity costs) to identify which country has a comparative advantage and then instruct firms (perhaps by government decree) as to which goods they ought to produce.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch02_s09_p02">Fortunately, none of this is necessary if the market, or the invisible hand, is allowed to operate. Instead, firms, or their owners, motivated entirely by profit, would automatically choose the appropriate good to produce and trade. In so doing, they would be led to maximize the output of goods and satisfy consumer demands to the extent possible given the limited resources in the economy.

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch02_s09_s01_p05">which means that the autarky price of wine is higher in the United States (in terms of cheese) than it is in France. In other words, a gallon of wine can be exchanged for more cheese in the United States than it will yield in the French market.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch02_s09_s01_p06">Next, suppose the barriers to trade that induced autarky are suddenly lifted and the United States and France are allowed to trade freely. For simplicity, we assume there are no transportation costs to move the products across borders.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch02_s09_s01_p07">Differences in price ratios between countries and the desire to make more profit are sufficient to generate international trade. To explain why, it is useful to incorporate some friction in the trading process and to tell a dynamic story about how a new free trade equilibrium is reached.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch02_s09_s01_p08">First, note that the higher price of cheese in France means that cheese workers in the United States could get more wine for their cheese in France than in the United States. Suppose one by one over time cheese workers begin to take advantage of the opportunity for trade and begin to sell their cheese in the French market. We assume that some workers are more internationally adroit and thus move first. The motivation here is profit. Workers want to get more for the goods they are selling. As the U.S. cheese workers appear in the French market, the supply of cheese increases. This also represents exports of cheese from the United States to France. The increased supply will reduce the price of cheese in the French market, meaning that over time, the quantity of wine obtained for a pound of cheese will fall. Thus <em class="emphasis">P</em><sub class="subscript"><em class="emphasis">C</em></sub>∗/<em class="emphasis">P</em><sub class="subscript"><em class="emphasis">W</em></sub>∗ falls once trade is opened.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch02_s09_s01_p09">Next, consider French wine workers immediately after trade opens. Since the price of wine is higher in the United States, French wine workers will one by one over time begin to sell their wine in the U.S. market. This represents exports of wine from France to the United States. The increased supply of wine to the United States lowers its price on the U.S. market. Thus each gallon of wine will trade for less and less cheese. This means <em class="emphasis">P</em><sub class="subscript"><em class="emphasis">W</em></sub>/<em class="emphasis">P</em><sub class="subscript"><em class="emphasis">C</em></sub> falls, which also means that its reciprocal, <em class="emphasis">P</em><sub class="subscript"><em class="emphasis">C</em></sub>/<em class="emphasis">P</em><sub class="subscript"><em class="emphasis">W</em></sub>, rises.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch02_s09_s01_p10">These shifts in supply will continue as long as the prices for the goods continue to differ between the two markets. Once the prices are equalized, there will be no incentive to trade any additional amount. Equalized prices mean that a pound of cheese will trade for the same number of gallons of wine in both markets. The free trade prices will be those prices that equalize total supply of each good in the world with total demand for each good.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch02_s09_s01_p11">As a result of trade, the price ratio, or terms of trade, will lie in between the two countries’ autarky price ratios. In other words, the following inequality will result:</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch02_s09_s01_p12">Whether the free trade price ratio will be closer to the U.S. or France’s autarky price ratio will depend on the relative demands of cheese to wine in the two countries. These demands in turn will depend on the size of the countries. If the United States is a much larger country, in that it has a larger workforce, it will have a larger demand for both wine and cheese. When trade opens, the addition of France’s supply and demand will have a relatively small effect on the U.S. price. Thus the free trade price ratio will be closer to the U.S. autarky price ratio.</p>

This also means that shortly after trade begins, the price of cheese (measured in terms of wine) exceeds the cost of producing cheese (also measured in terms of wine). Normally, when we measure the price and cost in dollar terms, when the price per unit exceeds the cost per unit, then positive profit is realized. The same is true when we measure the price and cost in terms of wine. Thus as soon as trade begins to change prices, cheese production becomes more profitable in the United States. And because we assume people are profit seeking, they will therefore seek to expand cheese production. But where will they find the workers to do so? There is only one place: wine workers. To expand cheese production, the country will have to give up wine production. But why do that?</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch02_s09_s02_p04">Well, when the price of cheese in terms of wine exceeds the opportunity cost of cheese, it is also true, via cross multiplication, that</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch02_s09_s02_p05">This means that the cost of producing wine (in terms of cheese) exceeds the price of wine (also in terms of cheese). Because cost is greater than price, profit is negative in the wine industry in the United States. That means wine producers have an incentive to shut down. And when they do, those workers can be moved into the cheese industry, where profit seekers wish to expand.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch02_s09_s02_p06">Thus, as long as individuals are profit seeking, the price differences that arise in autarky will be sufficient to induce export and specialization in the comparative advantage good. There is no need to use the complicated opportunity cost formula to first identify the comparative advantage good and no need to tell anyone what to do. Instead, the free market mechanism—Adam Smith’s invisible hand—is all that it takes.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch02_s10_p01">There are two ways to evaluate the welfare effects of trade in the Ricardian model. The first method evaluates the real wages of workers as two countries move from autarky to free trade. It is shown that the purchasing power of all workers’ wages in both countries would rise in moving to free trade.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch02_s10_p02">The focus on real wages allows us to see the effect of free trade on individual consumers in the economy. Nominal wages are not sufficient to tell us if workers gain since, even if wages rise, the price of one of the goods also rises when moving to free trade. If the price rises by a greater percentage than the wage, the ability to purchase that good falls and the worker may be worse off.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch02_s10_p03">For this reason, we must consider real wages. The <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">real wage</a><span class="glossdef">The quantity of a good that can be purchased per unit of work. Real wage is a measure of the purchasing power of a wage and is an effective measure of well-being.</span></span> represents the purchasing power of wages—that is, the quantity of goods the wages will purchase. Real wages are typically measured by dividing nominal wages by a price index. The price index measures the average level of prices relative to a base year. The nominal wage is the amount of dollars the worker receives.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch02_s10_p04">In this model, we need not construct a price index since there are only two goods. Instead, we will look at the real wage of workers in terms of the purchasing power of each good. In other words, we will solve for a real wage in terms of purchases of both wine and cheese.</p>

However, wage comparisons of this kind are not sufficient in this model to determine who will produce what or whether trade can be advantageous. Instead, what matters is relative wage comparisons. In this model, a country will tend to specialize in the good in which it has the greatest real wage advantage. Thus if</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch02_s10_s08_p04">First, consider the fate of U.S. cheese workers. Since the unit labor requirement for cheese does not change in moving to free trade, there is also no change in the real wage in terms of cheese. However, since the price of cheese in terms of wine rises, U.S. cheese workers can get more wine for each unit of cheese in exchange. Thus the real wage of cheese workers in terms of wine rises. This means cheese workers are at least as well off in free trade as they were in autarky.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch02_s10_s08_p05">The worst outcome occurs if a cheese worker has no demand for wine. Perhaps an individual abstains from alcohol consumption. In this case, the worker would be able to buy just as much cheese in free trade as in autarky, but no more. Such a person would receive no benefit from free trade. However, every worker who demands both wine and cheese will be able to buy more of both goods.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch02_s10_s08_p06">As for the workers who worked in the wine industry in the United States in autarky, they are now cheesemakers earning cheesemaker wages. Since real wages for wine workers were the same as wages for cheese workers in autarky, and since cheese workers are no worse off with free trade, then wine workers must also be no worse off in free trade. Of course, the model assumes that the movement of workers from one industry to another is costless. In the immobile factor model, we address the implications of adjustment costs across industries.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch02_s10_s08_p07">In France, the real wage of winemakers in terms of how much wine they can buy remains constant, while the real wage in terms of cheese must go up. French cheesemakers have all become winemakers because of specialization, which means all French workers are no worse off and most likely better off as a result of free trade.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch02_s10_s08_p08"><em class="emphasis">The likely welfare effect of free trade, then, is that everyone in both trading countries benefits</em>. At the very worst, some individuals will be just as well off as in autarky. This result occurs for any free trade price ratio that lies between the autarky price ratios.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch02_s10_s08_p09">In David Ricardo’s original numerical example, he demonstrated that when both countries specialize in their comparative advantage goods and engage in free trade, both countries can experience gains from trade. However, his demonstration was only true for particular numerical values. By calculating real wage changes, it is shown that it doesn’t matter which price ratio emerges in free trade as long as it is between the autarky prices. Also, because all workers receive the same wage in each country, the real wage calculations tell us that everyone benefits equally in each country.</p>

<span class="title-prefix">2.12</span> Appendix: Robert Torrens on Comparative Advantage</h2>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch02_s12_p01">The first known statement of the principle of comparative advantage and trade appears in an article by Robert Torrens in 1815 titled <em class="emphasis">Essay on the External Corn Trade</em>. Torrens begins by describing the basic idea of absolute advantage as described by Adam Smith but goes on to suggest that the simple intuition is erroneous. He wrote,</p>
    <span class="blockquote block" id="fwk-61960-ch02_s12_bl01">
        <p class="para editable" id="fwk-61960-ch02_s12_p02">Suppose that there are in England, unreclaimed districts, from which corn might be raised at as small an expense of labor and capital, as from the fertile plains of Poland. This being the case, and all other things the same, the person who should cultivate our unreclaimed districts, could afford to sell his produce at as cheap a rate as the cultivator of Poland: and it seems natural to conclude, that if industry were left to take its most profitable direction, capital would be employed in raising corn at home, rather than bringing it in from Poland at an equal prime cost, and at much greater expense of carriage. But this conclusion, however obvious and natural it may, at first sight, appear, might, on closer examination, be found entirely erroneous. If England should have acquired such a degree of skill in manufactures, that, with any given portion of her capital, she could prepare a quantity of cloth, for which the Polish cultivator would give a greater quantity of corn, then she could, with the same portion of capital, raise from her own soil, then, tracts of her territory, though they should be equal, nay, even though they should be superior, to the lands in Poland, will be neglected; and a part of her supply of corn will be imported from that country.</p>
    </span>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch02_s12_p03">In the first part of the passage, Torrens considers a case in which the cost of producing corn, in terms of labor and capital usage, is the same in England as it is in Poland. He points out that producers could afford to sell both English and Polish corn at the same low price. However, since it would cost additional resources to transport the corn from Poland to England (expense of carriage), it makes intuitive sense that corn should be produced in England, rather than imported, since Polish corn would wind up with a higher price than English corn in the English market.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch02_s12_p04">He continues by suggesting that this conclusion is erroneous. Why? Suppose England were to remove some capital (and labor) from the production of corn and move it into the production of manufactured goods. Suppose further that England trades this newly produced quantity of manufactured goods for corn with Poland. This outcome would be better for England if the amount of corn that Poland is willing to trade for the manufactured goods is greater than the amount of corn that England has given up producing. If the excess corn that Poland is willing to trade is sufficiently large, then it may be more than enough to pay for the transportation costs between the two countries. Torrens’s final point is that this trading outcome may be superior for England even if the lands of England should be superior to the lands of Poland—in other words, even if corn can be more efficiently produced in England (i.e., at lower cost) than in Poland.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch02_s12_p05">This is the first explicit description of one of the major results from the theory of comparative advantage. It reflects Torrens’s understanding that a country might conceivably benefit from free trade while reducing or eliminating production of a good it is technologically superior at producing.</p>

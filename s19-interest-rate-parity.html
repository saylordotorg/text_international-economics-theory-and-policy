    <p class="para editable block" id="suranfin-ch05_p01">Interest rate parity is one of the most important theories in international finance because it is probably the best way to explain how exchange rate values are determined and why they fluctuate as they do. Most of the international currency exchanges occur for investment purposes, and therefore understanding the prime motivations for international investment is critical.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="suranfin-ch05_p02">The chapter applies the rate of return formula developed in <a class="xref" href="suranfin-ch04#suranfin-ch04">Chapter 15 "Foreign Exchange Markets and Rates of Return"</a> and shows how changes in the determinants of the rate of return on assets affect investor behavior on the foreign exchange market, which in turn affects the value of the exchange rate. The model is described in two different ways: first, using simple supply and demand curves; and second, using a rate of return diagram that will be used later with the development of a more elaborate macro model of the economy.</p>

In another vein, IRP suggests that transactions on a country’s financial account affect the value of the exchange rate on the foreign exchange (Forex) market. This contrasts with the purchasing power parity theory, which assumes that the actions of importers and exporters, whose transactions are recorded on the current account, induce changes in the exchange rate.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Interest Rate Parity Condition</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="suranfin-ch05_s01_s01_p01">Interest rate parity refers to a condition of equality between the rates of return on comparable assets between two countries. The term is somewhat of a misnomer on the basis of how it is being described here, as it should really be called rate of return parity. The term developed in an era when the world was in a system of fixed exchange rates. Under those circumstances, and as will be demonstrated in a later chapter, rate of return parity did mean the equalization of interest rates. However, when exchange rates can fluctuate, interest rate parity becomes rate of return parity, but the name was never changed.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="suranfin-ch05_s01_s01_p02">In terms of the rates of return formulas developed in <a class="xref" href="suranfin-ch04#suranfin-ch04">Chapter 15 "Foreign Exchange Markets and Rates of Return"</a>, interest rate parity holds when the rate of return on dollar deposits is just equal to the expected rate of return on British deposits, that is, when</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="suranfin-ch05_s01_s01_p03">Plugging in the above formula yields</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="suranfin-ch05_s01_s01_p04">This condition is often simplified in many textbooks by dropping the final term in which the British interest rate is multiplied by the exchange rate change. The logic is that the final term is usually very small especially when interest rates are low. The <em class="emphasis">approximate version</em> of the IRP condition then is</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="suranfin-ch05_s01_s01_p05">One should be careful, however. The approximate version would not be a good approximation when interest rates in a country are high. For example, back in 1997, short-term interest rates were 60 percent per year in Russia and 75 percent per year in Turkey. With these interest rates, the approximate formula would not give an accurate representation of rates of return.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Interest Rate Parity Theory</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="suranfin-ch05_s01_s02_p01">Investor behavior in asset markets that results in interest parity can also explain why the exchange rate may rise and fall in response to market changes. In other words, interest parity can be used to develop a model of exchange rate determination. This is known as the asset approach, or the interest rate parity model.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="suranfin-ch05_s01_s02_p02">The first step is to reinterpret the rate of return calculations described previously in more general (aggregate) terms. Thus instead of using the interest rate on a one-year certificate of deposit (CD), we will interpret the interest rates in the two countries as the average interest rates that currently prevail. Similarly, we will imagine that the expected exchange rate is the average expectation across many different individual investors. The rates of return then are the average expected rates of return on a wide variety of assets between two countries.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="suranfin-ch05_s01_s02_p03">Next, we imagine that investors trade currencies in the foreign exchange (Forex) market. Each day, some investors come to a market ready to supply a currency in exchange for another, while others come to demand currency in exchange for another.</p>

Let <em class="emphasis">S</em><sub class="subscript">£</sub> represent the supply of pounds in exchange for dollars at all different exchange rates that might prevail.

This means that British investors would seek to supply more pounds at higher pound values but U.S. investors would demand fewer pounds at higher pound values. This explains why the supply curve slopes upward and the demand curve slopes downward.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="suranfin-ch05_s01_s02_p06">The intersection of supply and demand specifies the equilibrium exchange rate (<em class="emphasis">E</em><sub class="subscript">1</sub>) and the quantity of pounds (<em class="emphasis">Q</em><sub class="subscript">1</sub>) traded in the market. When the Forex is at equilibrium, it must be that interest rate parity is satisfied. This is true because the violation of interest rate parity will cause investors to shift funds from one country to another, thereby causing a change in the exchange rate. This process is described in more detail in <a class="xref" href="suranfin-ch05#suranfin-ch05">Chapter 16 "Interest Rate Parity"</a>, <a class="xref" href="suranfin-ch05_s02#suranfin-ch05_s02">Section 16.2 "Comparative Statics in the IRP Theory"</a>.</p>

    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="suranfin-ch05_s02_p01">Comparative statics refers to an exercise in a model that assesses how changes in an exogenous variable will affect the values of the endogenous variables. The endogenous variables are those whose values are determined in the equilibrium. In the IRP model, the endogenous variables are the exchange rate value and—of lesser importance—the quantity of currencies exchanged on the Forex market. The exogenous variables are those whose values are given beforehand and are known by the model’s decision makers. In the IRP model, the exogenous variables are those that influence the positions of the rate of return curves, including the U.S. interest rate, the British interest rate, and the expected future exchange rate. Another way to describe this is that the endogenous variable values are determined within the model, while the exogenous variable values are determined outside of the model.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="suranfin-ch05_s02_p02">Comparative statics exercises enable one to answer a question like “What would happen to the exchange rate if there were an increase in U.S. interest rates?” When assessing a question like this, economists will invariably invoke the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">ceteris paribus</a><span class="glossdef">Means that all other exogenous variables are maintained at their original values when a change in one exogenous variable takes place.</span></span> assumption. Ceteris paribus means that we assume all other exogenous variables are maintained at their original values when we change the variable of interest. Thus if we assess what would happen to the exchange rate (an endogenous variable) if there were an increase in the U.S. interest rate (an exogenous variable) while invoking ceteris paribus, then ceteris paribus means keeping the original values for the other exogenous variables (in this case, the British interest rate and the expected future exchange rate) fixed.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="suranfin-ch05_s02_p03">It is useful to think of a comparative statics exercise as a controlled economic experiment. In the sciences, one can test propositions by controlling the environment of a physical system in such a way that one can isolate the particular cause-and-effect relationship. Thus, to test whether a ball and a feather will fall at the same rate in a frictionless vacuum, experimenters could create a vacuum environment and measure the rate of descent of the ball versus the feather. In economic systems, such experiments are virtually impossible because one can never eliminate all the “frictions.”</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="suranfin-ch05_s02_p04">However, by creating mathematical economic systems (i.e., an economic model), it becomes possible to conduct similar types of “experiments.” A comparative statics exercise allows one to isolate how a change in one exogenous variable affects the value of the equilibrium variable while controlling for changes in other variables that might also affect the outcome.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="suranfin-ch05_s03_p01">An alternative graphical approach is sometimes used to depict the equilibrium exchange rate in the foreign exchange (Forex) market. The graph is called the rate of return diagram since it depicts rates of return for assets in two separate countries as functions of the exchange rate. The equilibrium condition depicted in the diagram represents the interest rate parity condition. In effect, the diagram identifies the equilibrium exchange rate that must prevail to satisfy the interest rate parity condition.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="suranfin-ch05_s03_p02">Recall the rate of return formulas for deposits in two separate countries. Consider an investor, holding U.S. dollars, comparing the purchase of a one-year certificate of deposit (CD) at a U.S. bank with a one-year CD issued by a British bank. The rate of return on the U.S. deposit works out simply to be the U.S. interest rate shown below:</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="suranfin-ch05_s03_p03">The rate of return on the British asset, however, is a more complicated formula that depends on the British interest rate (<em class="emphasis">i</em><sub class="subscript">£</sub>), the spot exchange rate (<em class="emphasis">E</em><sub class="subscript">$/£</sub>), and the expected exchange rate (<em class="emphasis">E</em><sub class="subscript">$/£</sub><sup class="superscript"><em class="emphasis">e</em></sup>). In its simplest form it is written as follows:</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="suranfin-ch05_s03_p05">The <em class="emphasis">RoR</em><sub class="subscript">£</sub>, however, is a function of the exchange rate. Indeed, the relationship is negative since <em class="emphasis">E</em><sub class="subscript">$/£</sub> is in the denominator of the equation. This means that as <em class="emphasis">E</em><sub class="subscript">$/£</sub> rises, <em class="emphasis">RoR</em><sub class="subscript">£</sub> falls, and vice versa.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="suranfin-ch05_s03_p06">The intuition behind this negative relationship is obtained by looking at the alternative (equivalent) formula for <em class="emphasis">RoR</em><sub class="subscript">£</sub>:</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="suranfin-ch05_s03_p07">Recall that the exchange rate ratio represents the expected percentage change in the value of the pound. Suppose, as an example, that this term were positive. That would mean the investor believes the pound will appreciate during the term of the investment. Furthermore, since it is an expected appreciation of the pound, it will add to the total rate of return on the British investment. Next, suppose the spot exchange rate (<em class="emphasis">E</em><sub class="subscript">$/£</sub>) rises today. Assuming ceteris paribus, as we always do in these exercises, the expected exchange rate remains fixed. That will mean the numerator of the exchange rate expression will fall in value, as will the value of the entire expression. The interpretation of this change is that the investor’s expected appreciation of the pound falls, which in turn lowers the overall rate of return. Hence, we get the negative relationship between the $/£ exchange rate and <em class="emphasis">RoR</em><sub class="subscript">£</sub>.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="suranfin-ch05_s03_p08">The intersection of the two RoR curves in the diagram identifies the unique exchange rate <em class="emphasis">E</em>′<sub class="subscript">$/£</sub> that equalizes rates of return between the two countries. This exchange rate is in equilibrium because any deviations away from interest rate parity (IRP) will motivate changes in investor behavior and force the exchange back to the level necessary to achieve IRP. The equilibrium adjustment story is next.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="suranfin-ch05_s04_p01">Any equilibrium in economics has an associated behavioral story to explain the forces that will move the endogenous variable to the equilibrium value. In the foreign exchange (Forex) model, the endogenous variable is the exchange rate. This is the variable that is determined as a solution in the model and will change to achieve the equilibrium. Variables that do not change in the adjustment to the equilibrium are the exogenous variables. In this model, the exogenous variables are <em class="emphasis">E</em><sub class="subscript">$/£</sub><sup class="superscript"><em class="emphasis">e</em></sup>, <em class="emphasis">i</em><sub class="subscript">$</sub>, and <em class="emphasis">i</em><sub class="subscript">£</sub>.

This will be the value of the U.S. interest rate. The rate of return on the pound, <em class="emphasis">RoR</em><sub class="subscript">£</sub> is given by the value <em class="emphasis">B</em>, however. This means that <em class="emphasis">RoR</em><sub class="subscript">£</sub> &lt; <em class="emphasis">RoR</em><sub class="subscript">$</sub> and IRP does not hold. Under this circumstance, higher returns on deposits in the United States will motivate investors to invest funds in the United States rather than Britain. This will raise the supply of pounds on the Forex as British investors seek the higher average return on U.S. assets. It will also lower the demand for British pounds (£) by U.S. investors who decide to invest at home rather than abroad. Both changes in the Forex market will lower the value of the pound and raise the U.S. dollar value, reflected as a reduction in <em class="emphasis">E</em><sub class="subscript">$/£</sub>.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="suranfin-ch05_s04_s01_p03">In more straightforward terms, when the rate of return on dollar deposits is higher than on British deposits, investors will increase demand for the higher RoR currency and reduce demand for the other.

    <p class="para editable block" id="suranfin-ch05_s07_p01">Suppose that the foreign exchange market (Forex) is initially in equilibrium such that <em class="emphasis">RoR</em><sub class="subscript">£</sub> = <em class="emphasis">RoR</em><sub class="subscript">$</sub> (i.e., interest rate parity holds) at an initial equilibrium exchange rate given by <em class="emphasis">E</em>′<sub class="subscript">$/£</sub>. The initial equilibrium is depicted in <a class="xref" href="#suranfin-ch05_s07_f01">Figure 16.9 "Effects of an Expected Exchange Rate Change in a RoR Diagram"</a>. Next, suppose investors’ beliefs shift so that <em class="emphasis">E</em><sub class="subscript">$/£</sub><sup class="superscript"><em class="emphasis">e</em></sup> rises, ceteris paribus. Ceteris paribus means we assume all other exogenous variables remain fixed at their original values. In this model, the U.S. interest rate (<em class="emphasis">i</em><sub class="subscript">$</sub>) and the British interest rate (<em class="emphasis">i</em><sub class="subscript">£</sub>) both remain fixed as the expected exchange rate rises.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="suranfin-ch05_s07_p02">An expected exchange rate increase means that if investors had expected the pound to appreciate, they now expect it to appreciate even more. Likewise, if investors had expected the dollar to depreciate, they now expect it to depreciate more. Alternatively, if they had expected the pound to depreciate, they now expect it to depreciate less. Likewise, if they had expected the dollar to appreciate, they now expect it to appreciate less.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="suranfin-ch05_s07_p03">This change might occur because new information is released. For example, the British Central Bank might release information that suggests an increased chance that the pound will rise in value in the future.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="suranfin-ch05_s07_p04">The increase in the expected exchange rate (<em class="emphasis">E</em><sub class="subscript">$/£</sub><sup class="superscript"><em class="emphasis">e</em></sup>) will shift the British RoR line to the right from <em class="emphasis">RoR</em>′<sub class="subscript">£</sub> to <em class="emphasis">RoR</em>″<sub class="subscript">£</sub> as indicated by step 1 in the figure.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="suranfin-ch05_s07_p05">The reason for the shift can be seen by looking at the simple rate of return formula:</p>
    <span class="informalequation block"><math xml:id="suranfin-ch05_m010" display="block"> <semantics><mrow><mi>R</mi><mi>o</mi><msub><mi>R</mi><mtext>£</mtext></msub><mo>=</mo><mfrac><mrow><msubsup><mi>E</mi><mrow><mtext>$/£</mtext></mrow><mtext>e</mtext></msubsup></mrow><mrow><msub><mi>E</mi><mrow><mtext>$/£</mtext></mrow></msub></mrow></mfrac><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mn>1</mn><mo>+</mo><msub><mi>i</mi><mtext>£</mtext></msub><mo stretchy="false">)</mo><mo>−</mo><mn>1.</mn></mrow>  </semantics></math></span>
    <p class="para editable block" id="suranfin-ch05_s07_p06">Suppose one is at the original equilibrium with exchange rate <em class="emphasis">E</em>′<sub class="subscript">$/£</sub>. Looking at the formula, an increase in <em class="emphasis">E</em><sub class="subscript">$/£</sub><sup class="superscript"><em class="emphasis">e</em></sup> clearly raises the value of <em class="emphasis">RoR</em><sub class="subscript">£</sub> for any fixed values of <em class="emphasis">i</em><sub class="subscript">£</sub>. This could be represented as a shift to the right on the diagram from A to B. Once at B with a new expected exchange rate, one could perform the exercise used to plot out the downward sloping RoR curve. The result would be a curve, like the original, but shifted entirely to the right.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="suranfin-ch05_s07_p07">Immediately after the increase and before the exchange rate changes, <em class="emphasis">RoR</em><sub class="subscript">£</sub> &gt; <em class="emphasis">RoR</em><sub class="subscript">$</sub>. The adjustment to the new equilibrium will follow the “exchange rate too low” equilibrium story presented in <a class="xref" href="suranfin-ch05#suranfin-ch05">Chapter 16 "Interest Rate Parity"</a>, <a class="xref" href="suranfin-ch05_s04#suranfin-ch05_s04">Section 16.4 "Exchange Rate Equilibrium Stories with the RoR Diagram"</a>. Accordingly, higher expected British rates of return will make British pound investments more attractive to investors, leading to an increase in demand for pounds on the Forex and resulting in an appreciation of the pound, a depreciation of the dollar, and an increase in <em class="emphasis">E</em><sub class="subscript">$/£</sub>. The exchange rate will rise to the new equilibrium rate <em class="emphasis">E</em>″<sub class="subscript">$/£</sub> as indicated by step 2.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="suranfin-ch05_s07_p08">In summary, an increase in the expected future $/£ exchange rate will raise the rate of return on pounds above the rate of return on dollars, lead investors to shift investments to British assets, and result in an increase in the $/£ exchange rate (i.e., an appreciation of the British pound and a depreciation of the U.S. dollar).</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="suranfin-ch05_s07_p09">In contrast, a decrease in the expected future $/£ exchange rate will lower the rate of return on British pounds below the rate of return on dollars, lead investors to shift investments to U.S. assets, and result in a decrease in the $/£ exchange rate (i.e., a depreciation of the British pound and an appreciation of the U.S. dollar).</p>

In the empty boxes, indicate the effect of the change, sequentially, on the variables listed in the first column. For example, a decrease in U.S. interest rates will cause a decrease in the rate of return (RoR) on U.S. assets. Therefore a “−” is placed in the first box of the table. Next in sequence, answer how the RoR on euro assets will be affected. Use the interest rate parity model to determine the answers. You do not need to show your work. Use the following notation:</p>

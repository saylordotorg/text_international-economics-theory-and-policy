    <p class="para editable block" id="suranfin-ch10_s01_p01">This chapter uses the AA-DD model to describe the effects of fiscal and monetary policy under a system of floating exchange rates. Fiscal and monetary policies are the primary tools governments use to guide the macroeconomy. In introductory macroeconomics courses, students learn how fiscal and monetary policy levers can be used to influence the level of gross national product (GNP), the inflation rate, the unemployment rate, and interest rates. In this chapter, that analysis is expanded to an open economy (i.e., one open to trade) and to the effects on exchange rates and current account balances.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="suranfin-ch10_s01_s01_p01">Using the AA-DD model, several important relationships between key economic variables are shown:</p>

            <li>In the long run, once inflation effects are included, expansionary monetary policy (↑<em class="emphasis">M</em><sup class="superscript"><em class="emphasis">S</em></sup>) in a full employment economy causes no long-term change in GNP and a depreciation of the domestic currency in a floating exchange rate system.

            <li>A central bank can influence the exchange rate with direct Forex interventions (buying or selling domestic currency in exchange for foreign currency). To sell foreign currency and buy domestic currency, the central bank must have a stockpile of foreign currency reserves.</li>
            <li>A central bank can also influence the exchange rate with indirect open market operations (buying or selling domestic treasury bonds). These transactions work through money supply changes and their effect on interest rates.</li>
            <li>Purchases (sales) of foreign currency on the Forex will raise (lower) the domestic money supply and cause a secondary indirect effect upon the exchange rate.</li>

        <p class="para editable block" id="suranfin-ch10_s01_s02_p01">The AA-DD model was developed to describe the interrelationships of macroeconomic variables within an open economy. Since some of these macroeconomic variables are controlled by the government, we can use the model to understand the likely effects of government policy changes. The two main levers the government controls are monetary policy (changes in the money supply) and fiscal policy (changes in the government budget). In this chapter, the AA-DD model is applied to understand government policy effects in the context of a floating exchange rate system. In <a class="xref" href="suranfin-ch12#suranfin-ch12">Chapter 23 "Policy Effects with Fixed Exchange Rates"</a>, we’ll revisit these same government policies in the context of a fixed exchange rate system.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="suranfin-ch10_s01_s02_p02">It is important to recognize that these results are what “would” happen under the full set of assumptions that describe the AA-DD model. These effects may or may not happen in reality. Despite this problem, the model surely captures some of the simple cause-and-effect relationships and therefore helps us to understand the broader implications of policy changes. Thus even if in reality many more elements not described in the model may act to influence the key endogenous variables, the AA-DD model at least gives a more complete picture of some of the expected tendencies.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch02_s05_p01">The basis for trade in the Ricardian model is differences in technology between countries. Below we define two different ways to describe technology differences. The first method, called absolute advantage, is the way most people understand technology differences. The second method, called comparative advantage, is a much more difficult concept. As a result, even those who learn about comparative advantage often will confuse it with absolute advantage. It is quite common to see misapplications of the principle of comparative advantage in newspaper and journal stories about trade. Many times authors write “comparative advantage” when in actuality they are describing absolute advantage. This misconception often leads to erroneous implications, such as a fear that technology advances in other countries will cause our country to lose its comparative advantage in everything. As will be shown, this is essentially impossible.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch02_s05_p02">To define absolute advantage, it is useful to define labor productivity first. To define comparative advantage, it is useful to first define opportunity cost. Next, each of these is defined formally using the notation of the Ricardian model.</p>

In the context of national production, the nation has opportunities to produce wine and cheese. If the nation wishes to produce more cheese, then because labor resources are scarce and fully employed, it is necessary to move labor out of wine production in order to increase cheese production. The loss in wine production necessary to produce more cheese represents the opportunity cost to the economy. The slope of the PPF, −(<em class="emphasis">a</em><sub class="subscript"><em class="emphasis">LC</em></sub>/<em class="emphasis">a</em><sub class="subscript"><em class="emphasis">LW</em></sub>), corresponds to the opportunity cost of production in the economy.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch02_s05_s03_p05">Thus the slope of the PPF expresses the number of gallons of wine that must be given up (hence the minus sign) to produce another pound of cheese. Hence it is the opportunity cost of cheese production (in terms of wine). The reciprocal of the slope, −(<em class="emphasis">a</em><sub class="subscript"><em class="emphasis">LW</em></sub>/<em class="emphasis">a</em><sub class="subscript"><em class="emphasis">LC</em></sub>), in turn represents the opportunity cost of wine production (in terms of cheese).</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch02_s05_s03_p06">Since in the Ricardian model the PPF is linear, the opportunity cost is the same at all possible production points along the PPF.

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch02_s05_s04_s02_p01">Another way to describe comparative advantage is to look at the relative productivity advantages of a country. In the United States, the labor productivity in cheese is 1/10, while in France it is 1/20. This means that the U.S. productivity advantage in cheese is (1/10)/(1/20) = 2/1. Thus the United States is twice as productive as France in cheese production. In wine production, the U.S. advantage is (1/2)/(1/5) = (2.5)/1. This means the United States is two and one-half times as productive as France in wine production.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch02_s05_s04_s02_p03">Also consider France’s perspective. Since the United States is two times as productive as France in cheese production, then France must be 1/2 times as productive as the United States in cheese. Similarly, France is 2/5 times as productive in wine as the United States. Since 1/2 &gt; 2/5, France has a disadvantage in production of both goods. However, France’s disadvantage is smallest in cheese; therefore, France has a comparative advantage in cheese.</p>

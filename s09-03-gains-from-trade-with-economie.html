        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch06_s03_s04_p04">The important result here is that it is possible to find a reallocation of labor across industries and countries such that world output of both goods rises. Or in other words, there is an increase in world productive efficiency.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch06_s03_s04_p05">If output of both goods rises, then surely it must be possible to find a terms of trade such that both countries would gain from trade. For example, if France were to export sixty tons of steel and import thirty racks of clothing, then each country would consume seventy units of clothing (twenty more than in autarky) and sixty tons of steel (ten more than in autarky).</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch06_s03_s04_p06">The final conclusion of this numerical example is that when there are economies of scale in production, then free trade, after an appropriate reallocation of labor, can improve national welfare for both countries relative to autarky. The welfare improvement arises because concentrating production in the economies-of-scale industry in one country allows one to take advantage of the productive efficiency improvements.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Some Noteworthy Features</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch06_s03_s05_p01">Some features of the economies-of-scale model make it very different from the other models of trade, such as the Ricardian or Heckscher-Ohlin models. For example, it is possible to show that countries that are identical in every respect might nevertheless find it advantageous to trade. Thus it is not always differences between countries that stimulate trade. In this case, it is a feature of the production process (i.e., economies of scale) that makes trade gains possible.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch06_s03_s05_p02">Second, this economies-of-scale model cannot predict which country would export which good. It doesn’t matter which country produces all the economies-of-scale good. As long as one country does so and trades it with the rest of the world, trade gains are possible. Also, it may not matter whether your country ends up producing the economies-of-scale good or not because both countries will realize the benefits as long as an appropriate terms of trade arises.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch06_s03_s05_p03">Despite these differences with other models, the main similarity is that gains from trade arise because of an improvement in productive efficiency. By reallocating resources between industries within countries, it is possible to produce more output with the same amount of resources. This remains the prime motivation in support of free trade.</p>

                <li>By shifting production in one country to production of the good that exhibits economies of scale and shifting production toward the other good in the other country, it is possible to raise total output in the world with the same total resources.</li>
                <li>Countries that are identical in every respect can benefit from trade in the presence of economies of scale.</li>
                <li>Countries that are identical would have no natural incentive to trade because there would be no price differences between countries.</li>
                <li>A simple economies-of-scale model does not predict which country would export which good.</li>

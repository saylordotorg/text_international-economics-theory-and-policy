    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch07_s03_p01">A partial equilibrium analysis distinguishes between the welfare of consumers who purchase a product and the producers who produce it. Consumer welfare is measured using consumer surplus, while producer welfare is measured using producer surplus. Revenue collected by the government is assumed to be redistributed to others. Government revenue is either spent on public goods or is redistributed to someone in the economy, thus raising someone’s welfare.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch07_s03_s01_p01">Consumer surplus is used to measure the welfare of a group of consumers who purchase a particular product at a particular price. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Consumer surplus</a><span class="glossdef">The difference between what consumers are willing to pay for a unit of the good and the amount consumers actually do pay for the product.</span></span> is defined as the difference between what consumers are willing to pay for a unit of the good and the amount consumers actually do pay for the product. Willingness to pay can be read from a market demand curve for a product. The market demand curve shows the quantity of the good that would be demanded by all consumers at each and every price that might prevail. Read the other way, the demand curve tells us the maximum price that consumers would be willing to pay for any quantity supplied to the market.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch07_s03_s01_p02">A graphical representation of consumer surplus can be derived by considering the following exercise. Suppose that only one unit of a good is available in a market. As shown in <a class="xref" href="#fwk-61960-ch07_s03_s01_f01">Figure 7.7 "Calculating Consumer Surplus"</a>, that first unit could be sold at the price <em class="emphasis">P</em><sub class="subscript">1</sub>. In other words, there is a consumer in the market who would be willing to pay <em class="emphasis">P</em><sub class="subscript">1</sub>. Presumably that person either has a relatively high desire or need for the product or the person has a relatively high income. To sell two units of the good, the price would have to be lowered to <em class="emphasis">P</em><sub class="subscript">2</sub>. (This assumes that the firm cannot perfectly price discriminate and charge two separate prices to two customers.) A slightly lower price might induce another customer to purchase the product or might induce the first customer to buy two units. Three units of the good could be sold if the price is lowered to <em class="emphasis">P</em><sub class="subscript">3</sub>, and so on.</p>

Now let’s go back to the first unit that could have been sold. The person who would have been willing to pay <em class="emphasis">P</em><sub class="subscript">1</sub> for a unit of the good ultimately pays only <em class="emphasis">P</em> for the unit. The difference between the two prices represents the amount of consumer surplus that accrues to that person.

Thus total consumer surplus can reasonably be measured as the area between the demand curve and the horizontal line drawn at the equilibrium market price.

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch07_s03_s02_p05">Producer surplus can be interpreted as the amount of revenue allocated to fixed costs and profit in the industry. This is because the market supply curve corresponds to industry marginal costs. Recall that firms choose output in a perfectly competitive market by setting the price equal to the marginal cost. Thus the marginal cost is equal to the price <em class="emphasis">P</em> in <a class="xref" href="#fwk-61960-ch07_s03_s02_f02">Figure 7.10 "Interpreting Producer Surplus"</a> at an industry output equal to <em class="emphasis">Q</em>. The marginal cost represents the addition to cost for each additional unit of output. As such, it represents an additional <em class="emphasis">variable</em> cost for each additional unit of output. This implies that the area under the supply curve at an output level such as <em class="emphasis">Q</em> represents the total variable cost (TVC) to the industry, shown as the blue area in <a class="xref" href="#fwk-61960-ch07_s03_s02_f02">Figure 7.10 "Interpreting Producer Surplus"</a>.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch07_s03_s02_p06">On the other hand, the market price multiplied by the quantity produced (<em class="emphasis">P</em> × <em class="emphasis">Q</em>) represents the total revenue received by firms in the industry. This is represented by the sum of the blue and yellow areas in the diagram. The difference between the total revenue and the total variable cost, in turn, represents payments made to fixed factors of production, or total fixed cost (TFC), and any short-run profits (Π) accruing to firms in the industry (the yellow area in the figure—that is, the area between the price line and the supply curve). This area is the same as the producer surplus.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch07_s03_s02_p07">Since fixed factors of production represent capital equipment that must be installed by the owners of the firms before any output can be produced, it is reasonable to use producer surplus to measure the well-being of the owners of the firms in the industry.</p>

Note that the change in producer surplus is determined as the area between the price that prevails before, the price that prevails after, and the supply curve. In this case, producer surplus rises because the price increases and output rises. The increase in price and output raises the return to fixed costs and the profitability of firms in the industry. The increase in output also requires an increase in variable factors of production such as labor.

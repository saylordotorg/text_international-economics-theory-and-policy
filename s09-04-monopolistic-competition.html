            <li>Identify the basic features of a monopolistic competition model.</li>

The model allows for the presence of increasing returns to scale in production and for differentiated (rather than homogeneous or identical) products. However, the model retains many features of perfect competition, such as the presence of many, many firms in the industry and the idea that free entry and exit of firms in response to profit would eliminate economic profit among the firms. As a result, the model offers a somewhat more realistic depiction of many common economic markets. The model best describes markets in which numerous firms supply products that are each slightly different from that supplied by its competitors. Examples include automobiles, toothpaste, furnaces, restaurant meals, motion pictures, romance novels, wine, beer, cheese, shaving cream, and much more.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch06_s04_p02">The model is especially useful in explaining the motivation for <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">intraindustry trade</a><span class="glossdef">Trade between countries that occurs within the same industry; for example, when a country exports and imports automobiles.</span></span>—that is, trade between countries that occurs within an industry rather than across industries. In other words, the model can explain why some countries export <em class="emphasis">and</em> import automobiles simultaneously. This type of trade, although frequently measured, is not readily explained in the context of the Ricardian or Heckscher-Ohlin models of trade. In those models, a country might export wine and import cheese, but it would never export and import wine at the same time.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch06_s04_p03">The model demonstrates not only that intraindustry trade may arise but also that national welfare can be improved as a result of international trade. One reason for the improvement in welfare is that individual firms produce larger quantities, which, because of economies of scale in production, leads to a reduction in unit production costs. This means there is an improvement in productive efficiency. The second reason welfare improves is that consumers are able to choose from a greater variety of available products with trade as opposed to autarky.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Overview</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch04_s04_s01_p01">The <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">immobile factor model</a><span class="glossdef">A standard Ricardian model with one variation in its assumptions, namely, that labor, the sole factor of production, is immobile between industries within a country.</span></span> highlights the effects of factor immobility between industries within a country when a country moves to free trade. The model is the standard Ricardian model with one variation in its assumptions. Whereas in the Ricardian model, labor can move costlessly between industries, in the immobile factor model, we assume that the cost of moving a factor is prohibitive. This implies that labor, the only factor, remains stuck in its original industry as the country moves from autarky to free trade.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch04_s04_s01_p02">The assumption of labor immobility allows us to assess the short-run impact of movements to free trade where the short run is defined as the period of time when all factors of production are incapable of moving between sectors. The main result of the model is that free trade will cause a redistribution of income such that some workers gain from trade, while others lose from trade.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="fwk-61960-ch04_s04_s02">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Assumptions</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch04_s04_s02_p01">The immobile factor model assumptions are identical to the Ricardian model assumptions with one exception. In this model, we assume that <em class="emphasis">L</em><sub class="subscript"><em class="emphasis">C</em></sub> and <em class="emphasis">L</em><sub class="subscript"><em class="emphasis">W</em></sub> are exogenous. This means that there is a fixed supply of cheese workers and wine workers. Cheese workers know how to make cheese but cannot be used productively in the wine industry, and wine workers cannot be used productively in the cheese industry. This assumption differs from the Ricardian model, which assumed that labor was freely mobile across industries. In the Ricardian model, a cheese worker who moved to the wine industry would be immediately as productive as a longtime wine worker.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch04_s04_s02_p02">Neither assumption—<span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">free and costless mobility</a><span class="glossdef">Factors that can be moved by their owners to another production process without impediment and without incurring any adjustment costs.</span></span> nor complete immobility—is entirely realistic. Instead, they represent two extreme situations. The Ricardian assumption can be interpreted as a long-run scenario. Given enough time, all factors can be moved and become productive in other industries. The immobile factor assumption represents an extreme short-run scenario. In the very short run, it is difficult for any factor to be moved and become productive in another industry. By understanding the effects of these two extremes, we can better understand what effects to expect in the real world, characterized by incomplete and variable factor mobility.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch04_s04_s02_p03">What follows is a description of the standard assumptions in the immobile factor model. We assume perfect competition prevails in all markets.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Number of Countries</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch04_s04_s02_s01_p01">The model assumes two countries to simplify the model analysis. Let one country be the United States, the other France. Note that anything related exclusively to France in the model will be marked with an asterisk.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch04_s04_s02_s02_p01">The model assumes there are two goods produced by both countries. We assume a barter economy. This means that no money is used to make transactions. Instead, for trade to occur, goods must be traded for other goods. Thus we need at least two goods in the model. Let the two produced goods be wine and cheese.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch04_s04_s02_s03_p01">The model assumes there are two factors of production used to produce wine and cheese. Wine production requires wine workers, while cheese production requires cheese workers. Although each of these factors is a kind of labor, they are different types because their productivities differ across industries.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch04_s04_s02_s04_p01">Factor owners are also the consumers of the goods. We assume the factor owners have a well-defined utility function defined over the two goods. Consumers maximize utility to allocate income between the two goods.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch04_s04_s02_s05_p01">The immobile factor model is a general equilibrium model. The income earned by the factor is used to purchase the two goods. The industries’ revenue in turn is used to pay for the factor services. The prices of the outputs and the factor are determined such that supply and demand are equalized in all markets simultaneously.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch04_s04_s02_s06_p01">We will assume that aggregate demand is homothetic in this model. This implies that the marginal rate of substitution between the two goods is constant along a ray from the origin. We will assume further that aggregate demand is identical in both of the trading countries.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-surantrade-fn04_002">Note that this assumption is a technical detail that affects how the trading equilibrium is depicted but is not very important in understanding the main results.</span></p>

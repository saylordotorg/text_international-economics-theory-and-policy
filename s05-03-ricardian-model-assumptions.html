    <div class="learning_objectives editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch02_s03_n01">
        <h3 class="title">Learning Objective</h3>
        <ol class="orderedlist" id="fwk-61960-ch02_s03_l01">
            <li>Learn the structure and assumptions that describe the Ricardian model of comparative advantage.</li>
        </ol>
    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch02_s03_p01">The Ricardian model shows the possibility that an industry in a developed country could compete against an industry in a less-developed country (LDC) even though the LDC industry pays its workers much lower wages.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch02_s03_p02">The modern version of the Ricardian model assumes that there are two countries producing two goods using one factor of production, usually labor. The model is a general equilibrium model in which all markets (i.e., goods and factors) are perfectly competitive. The goods produced are assumed to be homogeneous across countries and firms within an industry. Goods can be costlessly shipped between countries (i.e., there are no transportation costs). Labor is homogeneous within a country but may have different productivities across countries. This implies that the production technology is assumed to differ across countries. Labor is costlessly mobile across industries within a country but is immobile across countries. Full employment of labor is also assumed. Consumers (the laborers) are assumed to maximize utility subject to an income constraint.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch02_s03_p03">Below you will find a more complete description of each assumption along with a mathematical formulation of the model.</p>
    <div class="section" id="fwk-61960-ch02_s03_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Perfect Competition</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch02_s03_s01_p01">Perfect competition in all markets means that the following conditions are assumed to hold.</p>
        <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch02_s03_s01_l01">
            <li>Many firms produce output in each industry such that each firm is too small for its output decisions to affect the market price. This implies that when choosing output to maximize profit, each firm takes the price as given or exogenous.</li>
            <li>Firms choose output to maximize profit. The rule used by perfectly competitive firms is to choose the output level that equalizes the price (<em class="emphasis">P</em>) with the marginal cost (<em class="emphasis">MC</em>). That is, set <em class="emphasis">P</em> = <em class="emphasis">MC</em>.</li>
            <li>Output is homogeneous across all firms. This means that goods are identical in all their characteristics such that a consumer would find products from different firms indistinguishable. We could also say that goods from different firms are perfect substitutes for all consumers.</li>
            <li>There is free entry and exit of firms in response to profits. Positive profit sends a signal to the rest of the economy and new firms enter the industry. Negative profit (losses) leads existing firms to exit, one by one, out of the industry. As a result, in the long run economic profit is driven to zero in the industry.</li>
            <li>Information is perfect. For example, all firms have the necessary information to maximize profit and to identify the positive profit and negative profit industries.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Two Countries</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch02_s03_s02_p01">The case of two countries is used to simplify the model analysis. Let one country be the United States and the other France. Note that anything related exclusively to France in the model will be marked with an asterisk. The two countries are assumed to differ only with respect to the production technology.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="fwk-61960-ch02_s03_s03">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Two Goods</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch02_s03_s03_p01">Two goods are produced by both countries. We assume a barter economy. This means that no money is used to make transactions. Instead, for trade to occur, goods must be traded for other goods. Thus we need at least two goods in the model. Let the two produced goods be wine and cheese.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="fwk-61960-ch02_s03_s04">
        <h2 class="title editable block">One Factor of Production</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch02_s03_s04_p01">Labor is the one factor of production used to produce each of the goods. The factor is homogeneous and can freely move between industries.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="fwk-61960-ch02_s03_s05">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Utility Maximization and Demand</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch02_s03_s05_p01">In David Ricardo’s original presentation of the model, he focused exclusively on the supply side. Only later did John Stuart Mill introduce demand into the model. Since much can be learned with Ricardo’s incomplete model, we proceed initially without formally specifying demand or utility functions. Later in the chapter we will use the aggregate utility specification to depict an equilibrium in the model.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch02_s03_s05_p02">When needed, we will assume that aggregate utility can be represented by a function of the form <em class="emphasis">U</em> = <em class="emphasis">C</em><sub class="subscript"><em class="emphasis">C</em></sub><em class="emphasis">C</em><sub class="subscript"><em class="emphasis">W</em></sub>, where <em class="emphasis">C</em><sub class="subscript"><em class="emphasis">C</em></sub> and <em class="emphasis">C</em><sub class="subscript"><em class="emphasis">W</em></sub> are the aggregate quantities of cheese and wine consumed in the country, respectively. This function is chosen because it has properties that make it easy to depict an equilibrium. The most important feature is that the function is homothetic, which implies that the country consumes wine and cheese in the same fixed proportion at given prices regardless of income. If two countries share the same homothetic preferences, then when the countries share the same prices, as they will in free trade, they will also consume wine and cheese in the same proportion.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="fwk-61960-ch02_s03_s06">
        <h2 class="title editable block">General Equilibrium</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch02_s03_s06_p01">The Ricardian model is a general equilibrium model. This means that it describes a complete circular flow of money in exchange for goods and services. Thus the sale of goods and services generates revenue to the firms that in turn is used to pay for the factor services (wages to workers in this case) used in production. The factor income (wages) is used, in turn, to buy the goods and services produced by the firms. This generates revenue to the firms and the cycle repeats again. A “general equilibrium” arises when prices of goods, services, and factors are such as to equalize supply and demand in all markets simultaneously.</p>

Thus labor cannot move from one country to another in search of higher wages. However, labor is assumed to be freely and costlessly mobile between industries within a country. This means that workers working in the one industry can be moved to the other industry without any cost incurred by the firms or the workers.

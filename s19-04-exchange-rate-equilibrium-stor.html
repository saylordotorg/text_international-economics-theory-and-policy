    <p class="para editable block" id="suranfin-ch05_s04_p01">Any equilibrium in economics has an associated behavioral story to explain the forces that will move the endogenous variable to the equilibrium value. In the foreign exchange (Forex) model, the endogenous variable is the exchange rate. This is the variable that is determined as a solution in the model and will change to achieve the equilibrium. Variables that do not change in the adjustment to the equilibrium are the exogenous variables. In this model, the exogenous variables are <em class="emphasis">E</em><sub class="subscript">$/£</sub><sup class="superscript"><em class="emphasis">e</em></sup>, <em class="emphasis">i</em><sub class="subscript">$</sub>, and <em class="emphasis">i</em><sub class="subscript">£</sub>. Changes in the exogenous variables are necessary to cause an adjustment to a new equilibrium. However, in telling an equilibrium story, it is typical to simply assume that the endogenous variable is not at the equilibrium (for some unstated reason) and then explain how and why the variable will adjust to the equilibrium value.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Exchange Rate Too High</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="suranfin-ch05_s04_s01_p01">Suppose, for some unspecified reason, the exchange rate is currently at <em class="emphasis">E</em>″<sub class="subscript">$/£</sub> as shown in <a class="xref" href="#suranfin-ch05_s04_s01_f01">Figure 16.6 "Adjustment When the Exchange Rate Is Too High"</a>. The equilibrium exchange rate is at <em class="emphasis">E</em>′<sub class="subscript">$/£</sub> since at this rate, rates of return are equal and interest rate parity (IRP) is satisfied. Thus at <em class="emphasis">E</em>″<sub class="subscript">$/£</sub> the exchange rate is too high. Since the exchange rate, as written, is the value of the pound, we can also say that the pound value is too high relative to the dollar to satisfy IRP.</p>

        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="suranfin-ch05_s04_s01_p02">With the exchange rate at <em class="emphasis">E</em>″<sub class="subscript">$/£</sub>, the rate of return on the dollar, <em class="emphasis">RoR</em><sub class="subscript">$</sub>, is given by the value <em class="emphasis">A</em> along the horizontal axis. This will be the value of the U.S. interest rate. The rate of return on the pound, <em class="emphasis">RoR</em><sub class="subscript">£</sub> is given by the value <em class="emphasis">B</em>, however. This means that <em class="emphasis">RoR</em><sub class="subscript">£</sub> &lt; <em class="emphasis">RoR</em><sub class="subscript">$</sub> and IRP does not hold. Under this circumstance, higher returns on deposits in the United States will motivate investors to invest funds in the United States rather than Britain. This will raise the supply of pounds on the Forex as British investors seek the higher average return on U.S. assets. It will also lower the demand for British pounds (£) by U.S. investors who decide to invest at home rather than abroad. Both changes in the Forex market will lower the value of the pound and raise the U.S. dollar value, reflected as a reduction in <em class="emphasis">E</em><sub class="subscript">$/£</sub>.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="suranfin-ch05_s04_s01_p03">In more straightforward terms, when the rate of return on dollar deposits is higher than on British deposits, investors will increase demand for the higher RoR currency and reduce demand for the other. The change in demand on the Forex raises the value of the currency whose RoR was initially higher (the U.S. dollar in this case) and lowers the other currency value (the British pound).</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="suranfin-ch05_s04_s01_p04">As the exchange rate falls from <em class="emphasis">E</em>″<sub class="subscript">$/£</sub> to <em class="emphasis">E</em>′<sub class="subscript">$/£</sub>, <em class="emphasis">RoR</em><sub class="subscript">£</sub> begins to rise up, from <em class="emphasis">B</em> to <em class="emphasis">A</em>. This occurs because <em class="emphasis">RoR</em><sub class="subscript">£</sub> is negatively related to changes in the exchange rate. Once the exchange rate falls to <em class="emphasis">E</em>′<sub class="subscript">$/£</sub>, <em class="emphasis">RoR</em><sub class="subscript">£</sub> will become equal to <em class="emphasis">RoR</em><sub class="subscript">$</sub> at <em class="emphasis">A</em> and IRP will hold. At this point there are no further pressures in the Forex for the exchange rate to change, hence the Forex is in equilibrium at <em class="emphasis">E</em>′<sub class="subscript">$/£</sub>.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Exchange Rate Too Low</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="suranfin-ch05_s04_s02_p01">If the exchange rate is lower than the equilibrium rate, then the adjustment will proceed in the opposite direction. At any exchange rate below <em class="emphasis">E</em>′<sub class="subscript">$/£</sub> in the diagram, <em class="emphasis">RoR</em><sub class="subscript">£</sub> &gt; <em class="emphasis">RoR</em><sub class="subscript">$</sub>. This condition will inspire investors to move their funds to Britain with the higher rate of return. The subsequent increase in the demand for pounds will raise the value of the pound on the Forex and <em class="emphasis">E</em><sub class="subscript">$/£</sub> will rise (consequently, the dollar value will fall). The exchange rate will continue to rise and the rate of return on pounds will fall until <em class="emphasis">RoR</em><sub class="subscript">£</sub> = <em class="emphasis">RoR</em><sub class="subscript">$</sub> (IRP holds again) at <em class="emphasis">E</em>′<sub class="subscript">$/£</sub>.</p>

                <li>In the interest rate parity model, when the $/£ exchange rate is less than the equilibrium rate, the rate of return on British deposits exceeds the RoR on U.S. deposits. That inspires investors to demand more pounds on the Forex to take advantage of the higher RoR. Thus the $/£ exchange rate rises (i.e., the pound appreciates) until the equilibrium is reached when interest rate parity holds.</li>
                <li>In the interest rate parity model, when the $/£ exchange rate is greater than the equilibrium rate, the rate of return on U.S. deposits exceeds the RoR on British deposits. That inspires investors to demand more U.S. dollars on the Forex to take advantage of the higher RoR. Thus the $/£ exchange rate falls (i.e., the dollar appreciates) until the equilibrium is reached when interest rate parity holds.</li>

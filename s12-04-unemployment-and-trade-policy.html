            <li>Understand that unemployment of workers in a labor market is a type of market imperfection since supply of labor does not equal demand.</li>

    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch09_s04_p01">Consider a small perfectly competitive economy. Suppose this economy has a market imperfection in the form of relatively immobile factors of production across industries. We will imagine that the labor force develops sector-specific skills as the time of employment in an industry increases. Thus if a worker works in an industry—say, the textile industry—for a long period of time, her productivity in textile production rises relative to nontextile workers who might begin employment in the textile industry. Similarly, other workers become more productive in their own industries relative to a textile worker who might begin employment in another industry.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch09_s04_p02">These assumptions imply that although workers might be free to move across sectors of the economy, they might not be easily or costlessly transferred. Workers in one industry, accustomed to being paid a wage proportional to their productivity, might be unwilling to accept a lower wage in another industry even though the lower wage would reflect their productivity in that industry. A worker’s reluctance to transfer could lead to a long search time between jobs as the worker continues to look for an acceptable job at an acceptable wage.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch09_s04_p03">During the search period, a variety of adjustment costs would be incurred by the unemployed worker and by the government. The worker would suffer the anxiety of searching for another job. His or her family would have to adjust to a reduced income, and previous savings accounts would be depleted. At the worst, assets such as cars or homes may be lost. The government would compensate for some of the reduced income by providing unemployment compensation. This compensation would be paid out of tax revenues and thus represents a cost to others in the economy.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch09_s04_p04">In some instances, the productivity of transferred workers could be raised by incurring training costs. These costs might be borne by the individual worker, as when the individual enrolls in a vocational training school. The costs might also be borne by an employer who hires initially low-productivity workers but trains them to raise their skills and productivity in the new industry.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch09_s04_p05">In any case, the economy is assumed to have an unemployment imperfection that arises whenever resources must be transferred across industries. In every other respect, assume the economy is a small open economy with perfectly competitive markets and no other distortions or imperfections.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch09_s04_p06">In the standard case of a small perfectly competitive economy, the optimal trade policy is free trade. Any tariff or quota on imports, although beneficial to the import-competing industry, will reduce aggregate efficiency—that is, the aggregate losses will exceed the aggregate benefits.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch09_s04_p07">Imagine, however, that the economy initially has full employment of labor but that it has the unemployment imperfection described above. Suppose that initially the free trade price of textiles is given by <em class="emphasis">P</em><sub class="subscript">1</sub> in <a class="xref" href="#fwk-61960-ch09_s04_f01">Figure 9.1 "Unemployment in a Small Country Import Market"</a>.

    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch09_s04_p09">The surge can be represented by a reduction in the world price of the imported good from <em class="emphasis">P</em><sub class="subscript">1</sub> to <em class="emphasis">P</em><sub class="subscript">2</sub>. This would occur if there is an increase in total world supply of textiles of sufficient size to reduce the world price of the good.

    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch09_s04_p10">Domestic import-competing textile firms, to maintain profitability, would adjust to the lower free trade price by reducing output; supply would fall from <em class="emphasis">S</em><sub class="subscript">1</sub> to <em class="emphasis">S</em><sub class="subscript">2</sub>.

    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch09_s04_p11">Consumers benefit from the lower free trade price. Producers lose in terms of a reduction in producer surplus. However, the unemployment imperfection implies that there is an additional cost that is hidden in this analysis. For domestic firms to reduce output requires them to reduce variable costs of production, which will include layoffs of workers. This means that the adjustment to the new free trade equilibrium will cause unemployment and its associated costs. We’ll represent these unemployment or adjustment costs by the variable <em class="emphasis">F</em>. Note that these costs do not appear in <a class="xref" href="#fwk-61960-ch09_s04_f01">Figure 9.1 "Unemployment in a Small Country Import Market"</a>.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch09_s04_p12">The national welfare effects of the import surge depend on how high the unemployment costs (<em class="emphasis">F</em>) are compared to the aggregate benefits (<em class="emphasis">B</em> + <em class="emphasis">C</em> + <em class="emphasis">D</em>).

        <h2 class="title editable block">Effects of an Import Tariff</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch09_s04_s01_p01">It is possible to eliminate the costs of unemployment by applying a tariff on imports of textiles. Suppose in response to the sudden drop in the free trade price, the government responds by implementing a tariff equal to <em class="emphasis">P</em><sub class="subscript">1</sub> − <em class="emphasis">P</em><sub class="subscript">2</sub>. In this case, the domestic price would rise by the amount of the tariff. Instead of facing the new world price <em class="emphasis">P</em><sub class="subscript">2</sub>, the domestic country will face the original price <em class="emphasis">P</em><sub class="subscript">1</sub>.

Producers in the importing country experience an increase in well-being as a result of the tariff.

The government receives tariff revenue as a result of the tariff. Who benefits from the revenue depends on how the government spends it. Typically, the revenue is simply included as part of the general funds collected by the government from various sources. In this case, it is impossible to identify precisely who benefits. However, these funds help support many government spending programs that presumably either help most people in the country, as is the case with public goods, or target certain worthy groups. Thus someone within the country is the likely recipient of these benefits.

        <h2 class="title editable block">Unemployment Costs</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch09_s04_s02_p01">The tariff eliminates the unemployment or adjustment costs that would have been incurred in the absence of protection. Hence welfare rises by the amount <em class="emphasis">F</em>.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch09_s04_s02_p02">The aggregate welfare effect for the importing country is found by summing the gains and losses to consumers, producers, the government, and the potentially unemployed workers. The net effect consists of three components: a positive effect on workers who are saved from the negative effects of unemployment (<em class="emphasis">F</em>), a negative production distortion (<em class="emphasis">B</em>), and a negative consumption distortion (<em class="emphasis">D</em>).</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch09_s04_s02_p03">Whether the country benefits from protection in the presence of an unemployment imperfection depends on how the cost of unemployment compares with the standard aggregate welfare cost of protection. If the aggregate costs of unemployment (<em class="emphasis">F</em>) that would arise in the absence of a tariff exceed the deadweight costs of the tariff (i.e., <em class="emphasis">B</em> + <em class="emphasis">D</em>), then national welfare would rise when the tariff is implemented. The tariff would eliminate the adjustment costs of unemployment while imposing other lower costs on consumers who would lose the benefit of lower prices.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch09_s04_s02_p04">With a more completely specified model, one could determine the optimal level of protection in these circumstances. It is not necessarily true that the optimal tariff will be the tariff that maintains the price at the original level. Instead, the optimal tariff will be achieved when the marginal cost of raising it further is just equal to the marginal benefit of the reduction in unemployment costs. This may be lower than the level set in the example above.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="fwk-61960-ch09_s04_s03">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Objections to Protection</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch09_s04_s03_p01">Of course, it is also conceivable that the aggregate costs of the tariff (<em class="emphasis">B</em> + <em class="emphasis">D</em>) exceed the aggregate adjustment costs (<em class="emphasis">F</em>) incurred by those who would become unemployed. In this case, the optimal tariff would remain zero and it would be best for the country to allow the adjustment to proceed. Thus the mere presence of unemployment is not sufficient evidence to justify the use of protection.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch09_s04_s03_p02">Also, even if protection is beneficial in the aggregate, it is important to remember that protection generates a redistribution of income. A tariff will force consumers to pay higher prices than they would have to pay in free trade. The extra costs to consumers are essentially being transferred to the firms and workers in the import-competing industry and to the government in the form of tariff revenue.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch09_s04_s03_p03">Finally, one could object to protection by noting that the benefit of protection—that is, eliminating unemployment—represents the permanent avoidance of temporary costs. If free trade were maintained in the face of the import surge, unemployment and its associated costs would be incurred, but these costs are likely to be temporary. Eventually workers will find alternative employment opportunities in other industries and the adjustment costs will dissipate. However, the benefits of free trade in the form of lower prices for consumers would be permanent benefits. Lower prices would presumably prevail period after period into the future. This means that even if the one-period benefits of eliminating unemployment exceed the one-period costs of protection, this may not hold if evaluated over multiple periods.</p>

    <div class="section" id="fwk-61960-ch09_s04_s04">
        <h2 class="title editable block">First-Best versus Second-Best Policies</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch09_s04_s04_p01">Another objection to the use of a tariff to eliminate the cost of unemployment is that a tariff will be a second-best policy to correct the unemployment imperfection. The first-best policy would be a policy targeted more directly at the source of the market imperfection—in this case, the unemployment. Many such policies would be superior to a tariff. One easy-to-analyze policy is a production subsidy. A production subsidy means that the government would make payments, say, per unit of output produced by the domestic firms.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch09_s04_s04_p02">Begin with the same surge of imports described in <a class="xref" href="#fwk-61960-ch09_s04_f01">Figure 9.1 "Unemployment in a Small Country Import Market"</a> in the import market and with the same welfare costs and benefits. This time, however, suppose that the government offers a production subsidy sufficient to raise output in the domestic industry back to the original level. Recall that a production subsidy will raise the producer’s price by the amount of the subsidy for a small country and will maintain the consumer price at its original level. A specific production subsidy “<em class="emphasis">s</em>” set equal to the difference <em class="emphasis">P</em><sub class="subscript">1</sub> − <em class="emphasis">P</em><sub class="subscript">2</sub> would cause the producer price to rise to <em class="emphasis">P</em><sub class="subscript">1</sub> while the consumer price would remain at <em class="emphasis">P</em><sub class="subscript">2</sub>. The higher producer price will induce domestic firms to raise their supply back to the original level of <em class="emphasis">S</em><sub class="subscript">1</sub>, but the constant consumer price will keep domestic demand at <em class="emphasis">D</em><sub class="subscript">2</sub>.</p>

Producers in the importing country experience an increase in well-being as a result of the tariff. Although they receive the same free trade price in the market as before, they now also receive the per-unit subsidy payment from the government. That means that their surplus is measured off of the original supply curve.

The government must pay the per-unit production subsidy. The per-unit subsidy rate is given as the price difference (<em class="emphasis">P</em><sub class="subscript">1</sub> − <em class="emphasis">P</em><sub class="subscript">2</sub>), while the quantity of domestic production is given by <em class="emphasis">S</em><sub class="subscript">1</sub>. The product of these two terms gives the value of the subsidy payments made by the government. Who loses from the subsidy payments depends on where the tax revenue is collected. Generally, it is impossible to identify precisely which taxpayers lose.

        <h2 class="title editable block">Unemployment Costs</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch09_s04_s05_p01">The subsidy eliminates the unemployment or adjustment costs that would have been incurred in the absence of the subsidy. Hence welfare rises by the amount <em class="emphasis">F</em>.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch09_s04_s05_p02">The aggregate welfare effect for the importing country is found by summing the gains and losses to consumers, producers, the government, and the potentially unemployed workers. The net effect consists of two components: a positive effect on workers who are saved from the negative effects of unemployment (<em class="emphasis">F</em>) and a negative production distortion (<em class="emphasis">B</em>).</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch09_s04_s05_p03">Whether the country benefits from a production subsidy in the presence of an unemployment imperfection depends on how the cost of unemployment compares with the standard aggregate welfare cost of protection. If the aggregate costs of unemployment (<em class="emphasis">F</em>) that would arise in the absence of a tariff exceed the production efficiency losses of the subsidy (i.e., <em class="emphasis">B</em>), then national welfare would rise when the production subsidy is implemented. The production subsidy would eliminate the adjustment costs of unemployment but would cost the taxpayer extra money to finance the subsidy.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch09_s04_s05_p04">However, the key difference is the comparison of the production subsidy with the import tariff. Both policy actions could generate an improvement in national welfare, but the production subsidy would raise national welfare by more than the import tariff. In <a class="xref" href="#fwk-61960-ch09_s04_f01">Figure 9.1 "Unemployment in a Small Country Import Market"</a>, it can be seen that <em class="emphasis">F</em> − <em class="emphasis">B</em> &gt; <em class="emphasis">F</em> − <em class="emphasis">B</em> − <em class="emphasis">D</em>. For this reason, we might refer to the production subsidy as a first-best policy, while the import tariff is second best.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch09_s04_s05_p05">The production subsidy is superior because it corrects the imperfection more directly. By targeting production, the production subsidy creates a production distortion (<em class="emphasis">B</em>) but eliminates an unemployment imperfection. The tariff, on the other hand, creates a production <em class="emphasis">and</em> consumption distortion (<em class="emphasis">B</em> + <em class="emphasis">D</em>) to eliminate the same unemployment imperfection. Generally, it is preferable to introduce as few other distortions as possible in designing a policy to correct another.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch09_s04_s05_p06">This example shows how a production subsidy is superior to a tariff. However, in the case of an unemployment imperfection, there are likely to be policies superior to the production subsidy. It would seem that some policies would target the imperfection even more directly.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch09_s04_s05_p07">For example, the government could use a labor employment subsidy if the primary problem were the potential unemployment of labor. In this case, the government would make a payment to firms for each worker hired. If set at the correct level, the subsidy could eliminate the negative effects caused by unemployment. However, since firms would remain free to substitute labor for other inputs, industry production levels might not be the same as with a production subsidy. Firms’ freedom to adjust output could further reduce the cost of the additional distortion.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch09_s04_s05_p08">A labor employment subsidy, however, would not solve the problem of long-term adjustment. As mentioned, the cost associated with unemployment is likely to be temporary, while the cost of eliminating the unemployment with a subsidy would require a permanent taxpayer cost. Thus an even more superior policy would probably be one that is targeted even more directly at the source of the problem. Recall that the problem is in the adjustment process. Superior policies might be those that facilitate the adjustment of labor resources across industries.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch09_s04_s05_p09">In a sense, this is the purpose behind policies like trade adjustment assistance (TAA). TAA was originally implemented in the 1962 U.S. Trade Act. It provides for the extension of unemployment compensation, loans, and grants for technical retraining and other types of support programs for workers who are displaced as a result of trade liberalization. If TAA is designed and implemented in a cost-efficient manner, it could be first among the contenders for a first-best policy to correct an unemployment imperfection.</p>

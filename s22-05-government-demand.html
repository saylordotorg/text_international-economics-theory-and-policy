    <p class="para editable block" id="suranfin-ch08_s05_p01">Government demand refers to the government’s demand for goods and services produced in the economy. In some cases this demand is for G&amp;S produced by private businesses, as when the government purchases a naval aircraft. Other government demand is actually produced by the government itself, as what occurs with teachers providing educational services in the public schools. All levels of government demand—federal, state, and local—are included in this demand term. Excluded are transfer payments such as social insurance, welfare assistance, and unemployment compensation.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="suranfin-ch08_s05_p02">In this model, government demand is treated the same way as investment demand: it is assumed to be exogenous. This means that its value is determined outside of the model and is not dependent on any variable within the model. A simple equation for government demand can be written as</p>
    <span class="informalequation block"><span class="mathphrase"><em class="emphasis">G</em><sup class="superscript"><em class="emphasis">D</em></sup> = <em class="emphasis">G</em><sub class="subscript">0</sub>,</span></span>
    <p class="para editable block" id="suranfin-ch08_s05_p03">where the “0,” or naught, subscript on the right side indicates that the variable is exogenous or autonomous. In words, the equation says that government demand is given exogenously as <em class="emphasis">G</em><sub class="subscript">0</sub>.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="suranfin-ch08_s05_p04">This is a more common assumption in many other macro models, even though one could argue dependencies of government demand on GNP and interest rates. However, these linkages are not likely to be as strong as with investment, thus assuming exogeneity here is a more realistic assumption than with investment.</p>

            <li>Learn how individual transactions between a foreign and domestic resident are recorded on the balance of payments accounts.</li>
            <li>Learn the interrelationship between a country’s current account balance and its financial account balance and how to interpret current account deficits and surpluses in terms of the associated financial flows.</li>
        </ol>
    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="suranfin-ch02_s05_p01">In this section, we demonstrate how international transactions are recorded on the balance of payment accounts. The balance of payments accounts can be presented in ledger form with two columns. One column is used to record credit entries. The second column is used to record debit entries.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="suranfin-ch02_s05_p02">Almost every transaction involves an exchange between two individuals of two items believed to be of equal value.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-suranfin-fn02_001">An exception is the case of unilateral transfers. These transfers include pension payments to domestic citizens living abroad, foreign aid, remittances, and other types of currency transfers that do not include an item on the reverse side being traded.</span> Thus if one person exchanges $20 for a baseball bat with another person, then the two items of equal value are the $20 of currency and the baseball bat. The debit and credit columns in the ledger are used to record each side of every transaction. This means that every transaction must result in a credit and debit entry of equal value.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="suranfin-ch02_s05_p03">By convention, every credit entry has a “+” placed before it, while every debit entry has a “−” placed before it. The plus on the credit side generally means that money is being received in exchange for that item, while the minus on the debit side indicates a monetary payment for that item. This interpretation in the balance of payments accounts can be misleading, however, since in many international transactions, as when currencies are exchanged, money is involved on both sides of the transaction. There are two simple rules of thumb to help classify entries on the balance of payments:</p>
    <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="suranfin-ch02_s05_l02">
        <li>Any time an item (good, service, or asset) is <em class="emphasis">exported</em> from a country, the value of that item is recorded as a credit entry on the balance of payments.</li>
        <li>Any time an item is <em class="emphasis">imported</em> into a country, the value of that item is recorded as a debit entry on the balance of payments.</li>
    </ol>
    <p class="para editable block" id="suranfin-ch02_s05_p04">In the following examples, we will consider entries on the U.S. balance of payments accounts. Since it is a U.S. account, the values of all entries are denominated in U.S. dollars. Note that each transaction between a U.S. resident and a foreign resident would result in an entry on both the domestic and the foreign balance of payments accounts, but we will look at only one country’s accounts.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="suranfin-ch02_s05_p05">Finally, we will classify entries in the balance of payments accounts into one of the two major subaccounts, the current account or the financial account. Any time an item in a transaction is a good or a service, the value of that item will be recorded in the current account. Any time an item in a transaction is an asset, the value of that item will be recorded in the financial account.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="suranfin-ch02_s05_p06">Note that in June 1999, what was previously called the “capital account” was renamed the “financial account” in the U.S. balance of payments. A capital account stills exists but now includes only exchanges in nonproduced, nonfinancial assets. This category is very small, including such items as debt forgiveness and transfers by migrants. However, for some time, it will be common for individuals to use the term “capital account” to refer to the present “financial account.” So be warned.</p>
    <div class="section" id="suranfin-ch02_s05_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">A Simple Exchange Story</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="suranfin-ch02_s05_s01_p01">Consider two individuals, one a resident of the United States, the other a resident of Japan. We will follow them through a series of hypothetical transactions and look at how each of these transactions would be recorded on the balance of payments. The exercise will provide insight into the relationship between the current account and the financial account and give us a mechanism for interpreting trade deficits and surpluses.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="suranfin-ch02_s05_s01_p02"><strong class="emphasis bold">Step 1</strong>: We begin by assuming that each individual wishes to purchase something in the other country. The U.S. resident wants to buy something in Japan and thus needs Japanese currency (yen) to make the purchase. The Japanese resident wants to buy something in the United States and thus needs U.S. currency (dollars) to make the purchase. Therefore, the first step in the story must involve an exchange of currencies.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="suranfin-ch02_s05_s01_p03">So let’s suppose the U.S. resident exchanges $1,000 for ¥112,000 on the foreign exchange market at a spot exchange rate of 112 ¥/$. The transaction can be recorded by noting the following:</p>
        <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="suranfin-ch02_s05_s01_l01">
            <li>The transaction involves an exchange of currency for currency. Since currency is an asset, both sides of the transaction are recorded on the financial account.</li>
            <li>The currency exported is $1,000 in U.S. currency. Hence, we have made a credit entry in the financial account in the table below. What matters is not whether the item leaves the country, but that the ownership changes from a U.S. resident to a foreign resident.</li>
            <li>The currency imported into the country is the ¥112,000. We record this as a debit entry on the financial account and value it at the current exchange value, which is $1,000 as noted in the table.</li>
        </ol>

Since the transaction is between the U.S. resident and the Japanese store owner, it is an international transaction and must be recorded on the balance of payments. The item exported in this case is the Japanese currency. We’ll assume that there has been no change in the exchange rate and thus the currency is still valued at $1,000. This is recorded as a credit entry on the financial account and labeled “¥ currency” in the table below. The item being imported into the United States is a camera. Since a camera is a merchandise good and is valued at ¥112,000 = $1,000, the import is recorded as a debit entry on the current account in the table below.</p>

Therefore, a credit entry of $1,000 is made in the following table on the current account and labeled as “computer.” The other side of the transaction is the $1,000 of U.S. currency being given to the U.S. store owner by the Japanese resident.

        <p class="para editable block" id="suranfin-ch02_s05_s02_p01">We can construct summary statistics for the entries that have occurred so far by summing the debit and credit entries in each account and eliminating double entries. In the following table, we show all the transactions that have been recorded. The sum of credits in the current account is the $1,000 computer. The sum of debits in the current account is the $1,000 camera. On the financial account there are two credit entries of $1,000, one representing U.S. currency and the other representing Japanese currency. There are two identical entries on the debit side. Since there is a U.S. currency debit and credit entry of equal value, this means that the net flow of currency is zero. The dollars that left the country came back in subsequent transactions. The same is true for Japanese currency. When reporting the summary statistics, the dollar and yen currency financial account entries would cancel, leaving a net export of assets equal to zero and the net inflow of assets equal to zero as well.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Important Lessons from the Exchange Story</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="suranfin-ch02_s05_s04_p01">The exercise above teaches a number of important lessons. The first lesson follows from the summary statistics, suggesting that the following relationship must hold true:</p>
        <span class="informalequation block"><span class="mathphrase">current account balance + financial account balance = 0.</span></span>
        <p class="para editable block" id="suranfin-ch02_s05_s04_p02">In the first set of summary statistics (1, 2, 3a), both the current account and the financial account had a balance of zero. In the second example (1, 2, 3b), the current account had a deficit of $1,000 while the financial account had a surplus of $1,000.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="suranfin-ch02_s05_s04_p03">This implies that anytime a country has a current account deficit, it <em class="emphasis">must</em> have a financial account surplus of equal value. When a country has a current account surplus, it <em class="emphasis">must</em> have a financial account deficit of equal value. And when a country has balanced trade (a balanced current account), then it <em class="emphasis">must</em> have balance on its financial account.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="suranfin-ch02_s05_s04_p04">It is worth emphasizing that this relationship is <em class="emphasis">not</em> an economic theory. An economic theory could be right or it could be wrong. This relationship is an accounting identity. (That’s why an identity symbol rather than an equal sign is typically used in the formula above.) An accounting identity is true by definition.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="suranfin-ch02_s05_s04_p05">Of course, the identity is valid only if we use the <em class="emphasis">true</em> (or actual) current account and financial account balances. What countries report as their trade statistics are only the <em class="emphasis">measured</em> values for these trade balances, not necessarily the true values.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="suranfin-ch02_s05_s04_p06">Statisticians and accountants attempt to measure international transactions as accurately as possible. Their objective is to record the true values or to measure trade and financial flows as accurately as possible. However, a quick look at any country’s balance of payments statistics reveals that the balance on the current account plus the balance on the financial account rarely, if ever, sums to zero. The reason is not that the identity is wrong but rather that not all the international transactions on the balance of payments are accounted for properly. Measurement errors are common.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="suranfin-ch02_s05_s04_p07">These errors are reported in a line in the balance of payments labeled “statistical discrepancy.” The statistical discrepancy represents the amount that must be added or subtracted to force the measured current account balance and the measured financial account balance to zero. In other words, in terms of the measured balances on the balance of payments accounts, the following relationship will hold:</p>
        <span class="informalequation block"><span class="mathphrase">current account balance + financial account balance + statistical discrepancy = 0.</span></span>
        <p class="para editable block" id="suranfin-ch02_s05_s04_p08">The second lesson from this example is that imbalances (deficits and surpluses) on the balance of payments accounts arise as a result of a series of mutually voluntary transactions in which equally valued items are traded for each other. This is an important point because it is often incorrectly interpreted that a trade deficit implies that unfair trade is taking place. After all, the logic goes, when imports exceed exports, foreigners are <em class="emphasis">not</em> buying as many of our goods as we are buying of theirs. That’s unequal exchange and that’s unfair.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="suranfin-ch02_s05_s04_p09">The story and logic are partially correct but incomplete. The logic of the argument focuses exclusively on trade in goods and services but ignores trade in assets. Thus it <em class="emphasis">is</em> true that when imports of goods exceed exports, we are buying more foreign goods and services than foreigners are buying of ours. However, at the same time, a current account deficit implies a financial account surplus. A financial account surplus, in turn, means that foreigners are buying more of our assets than we are buying of theirs. Thus when there is unequal exchange on the trade account, there must be equally opposite unequal exchange on the financial account. In the aggregate, imbalances on a current account, a trade account, or a financial account do not represent unequal exchanges between countries.</p>

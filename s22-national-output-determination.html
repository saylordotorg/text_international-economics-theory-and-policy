    <p class="para editable block" id="suranfin-ch08_p01">In most introductory macroeconomics courses, the basic Keynesian model is presented as a way of showing how government spending and taxation policies can influence the size of a country’s growth national product (GNP). This chapter revisits the basic Keynesian model but adds an international angle by including impacts on domestic demand for goods and services caused by changes in the exchange rate. With this relationship in place, the chapter concludes with several comparative statics exercises showing how changes in key variables may influence the level of GNP.</p>

        </ol>
    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="suranfin-ch08_s01_p01">This chapter describes how the supply and demand for the national output of goods and services combine to determine the equilibrium level of national output for an economy. The model is called the goods and services market model, or just the G&amp;S market model.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="suranfin-ch08_s01_p02">In this model, we use gross national product (GNP) as the measure of national output rather than gross domestic product (GDP). This adjustment is made because we wish to define the trade balance (<em class="emphasis">EX</em> − <em class="emphasis">IM</em>) as the current account (defined as the difference between exports and imports of goods, services incomes payments/receipts, and unilateral transfers). This adjustment is discussed in more detail in <a class="xref" href="suranfin-ch08_s06#suranfin-ch08_s06">Section 19.6 "Export and Import Demand"</a>.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="suranfin-ch08_s01_p03">The diagram used to display this model is commonly known as the Keynesian cross. The model assumes, for simplicity, that the amount of national output produced by an economy is determined by the total amount demanded. Thus if, for some reason, the demand for GNP were to rise, then the amount of GNP supplied would rise up to satisfy it. If demand for the GNP falls—for whatever reason—then supply of GNP would also fall. Consequently, it is useful to think of this model as “demand driven.”</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="suranfin-ch08_s01_p04">The model is developed by identifying the key determinants of GNP demand. The starting point is the national income identity, which states that</p>
    <span class="informalequation block"><span class="mathphrase"><em class="emphasis">GNP</em> = <em class="emphasis">C</em> + <em class="emphasis">I</em> + <em class="emphasis">G</em> + <em class="emphasis">EX</em> − <em class="emphasis">IM</em>,</span></span>
    <p class="para editable block" id="suranfin-ch08_s01_p05">that is, the gross national product is the sum of consumption expenditures (<em class="emphasis">C</em>), investment expenditures (<em class="emphasis">I</em>), government spending (<em class="emphasis">G</em>), and exports (<em class="emphasis">EX</em>) minus imports (<em class="emphasis">IM</em>).</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="suranfin-ch08_s01_p06">Note that the identity uses GNP rather than GDP if we define <em class="emphasis">EX</em> and <em class="emphasis">IM</em> to include income payments, income receipts, and unilateral transfers as well as goods and services trade.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="suranfin-ch08_s01_p07">We rewrite this relationship as</p>
    <span class="informalequation block"><span class="mathphrase"><em class="emphasis">AD</em> = <em class="emphasis">C</em><sup class="superscript"><em class="emphasis">D</em></sup> + <em class="emphasis">I</em><sup class="superscript"><em class="emphasis">D</em></sup> + <em class="emphasis">G</em><sup class="superscript"><em class="emphasis">D</em></sup> + <em class="emphasis">EX</em><sup class="superscript"><em class="emphasis">D</em></sup> − <em class="emphasis">IM</em><sup class="superscript"><em class="emphasis">D</em></sup>,</span></span>
    <p class="para editable block" id="suranfin-ch08_s01_p08">where <em class="emphasis">AD</em> refers to aggregate demand for the GNP and the right-side variables are now read as consumption demand, investment demand, and so on. The model further assumes that consumption demand is positively related to changes in <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">disposable income</a><span class="glossdef">All the income households have at their disposal to spend. It is defined as national income (GNP), minus taxes taken away by the government, plus transfer payments that the government pays out to people.</span></span> (<em class="emphasis">Y</em><sub class="subscript"><em class="emphasis">d</em></sub>). Furthermore, since disposable income is in turn negatively related to taxes and positively related to transfer payments, these additional variables can also affect aggregate demand.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="suranfin-ch08_s01_p09">The model also assumes that demand on the current account (<em class="emphasis">CA</em><sup class="superscript"><em class="emphasis">D</em></sup> = <em class="emphasis">EX</em><sup class="superscript"><em class="emphasis">D</em></sup> − <em class="emphasis">IM</em><sup class="superscript"><em class="emphasis">D</em></sup>) is negatively related to changes in the domestic real currency value (i.e., the real exchange rate) and changes in disposable income. Furthermore, since the domestic real currency value is negatively related to the domestic price level (inflation) and positively related to the foreign price level, these variables will also affect current account demand.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="suranfin-ch08_s01_p10">Using the G&amp;S market model, several important relationships between key economic variables are shown:</p>
    <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="suranfin-ch08_s01_l02">
        <li>When government demand (<em class="emphasis">G</em>) or investment demand (<em class="emphasis">I</em>) for G&amp;S rises (falls), equilibrium GNP rises (falls).</li>
        <li>When disposable income rises (falls) due to a decrease (increase) in taxes or an increase (decrease) in transfer payments, equilibrium GNP increases (decreases).</li>
        <li>When the real exchange rate depreciates (appreciates), either due to a depreciation of the nominal exchange rate, an increase in the domestic price level, or a decrease in the foreign price level, equilibrium GNP rises (falls).</li>
    </ul>
    <div class="section" id="suranfin-ch08_s01_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Connections</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="suranfin-ch08_s01_s01_p01">The G&amp;S market model connects with the money market because the value of GNP determined in the G&amp;S model affects money demand. If equilibrium GNP rises in the G&amp;S model, then money demand will rise, causing an increase in the interest rate.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="suranfin-ch08_s01_s01_p02">The G&amp;S model also connects with the foreign exchange (Forex) market. The equilibrium exchange rate determined in the Forex affects the real exchange rate that in turn influences demand on the current account.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="suranfin-ch08_s01_s01_p03">A thorough discussion of these interrelationships is given in <a class="xref" href="suranfin-ch09#suranfin-ch09">Chapter 20 "The AA-DD Model"</a>.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Omissions</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="suranfin-ch08_s01_s02_p01">There is one important relationship omitted in this version of the G&amp;S model, and that is the relationship between interest rates and investment. In most standard depictions of the Keynesian G&amp;S model, it is assumed that increases (decreases) in interest rates will reduce (increase) demand for investment. In this version of the model, to keep things simple, investment is assumed to be exogenous (determined in an external process) and unrelated to the level of interest rates.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="suranfin-ch08_s01_s02_p02">Some approaches further posit that interest rates affect consumption demand as well. This occurs because household borrowing, to buy new cars or other consumer items, will tend to rise as interest rates fall. However, this relationship is also <em class="emphasis">not</em> included in this model.</p>

    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="suranfin-ch08_s03_p01">Consumption demand represents the demand for goods and services by individuals and households in the economy. This is the major category in the national income accounts for most countries, typically comprising from 50 percent to 70 percent of the gross national product (GNP) for most countries.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="suranfin-ch08_s03_p02">In this model, the main determinant of consumption demand is disposable income. Disposable income is all the income households have at their disposal to spend. It is defined as national income (GNP) minus taxes taken away by the government, plus <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">transfer payments</a><span class="glossdef">Government expenditures made to individuals or businesses without any good or service received in exchange. It includes social insurance payments, welfare payments and unemployment compensation.</span></span> that the government pays out to people. More formally, this is written as</p>
    <span class="informalequation block"><span class="mathphrase"><em class="emphasis">Y</em><sub class="subscript"><em class="emphasis">d</em></sub> = <em class="emphasis">Y</em> − <em class="emphasis">T</em> + <em class="emphasis">TR</em>,</span></span>
    <p class="para editable block" id="suranfin-ch08_s03_p03">where <em class="emphasis">Y</em><sub class="subscript"><em class="emphasis">d</em></sub> refers to disposable income, <em class="emphasis">Y</em> is real GNP, <em class="emphasis">T</em> is taxes, and <em class="emphasis">TR</em> represents transfer payments.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="suranfin-ch08_s03_p04">In this relationship, disposable income is defined in the same way as in the circular flow diagram presented in <a class="xref" href="suranfin-ch02#suranfin-ch02">Chapter 13 "National Income and the Balance of Payments Accounts"</a>, <a class="xref" href="suranfin-ch02_s07#suranfin-ch02_s07">Section 13.7 "The Twin-Deficit Identity"</a>. Recall that taxes withdrawn from GNP are assumed to be all taxes collected by the government from all sources. Thus income taxes, social insurance taxes, profit taxes, sales taxes, and property taxes are all assumed to be included in taxes (<em class="emphasis">T</em>). Also, transfer payments refer to all payments made by the government that do not result in the provision of a good or service. All social insurance payments, welfare payments, and unemployment compensation, among other things, are included in transfers (<em class="emphasis">TR</em>).</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="suranfin-ch08_s03_p05">In the G&amp;S model, demand for consumption G&amp;S is assumed to be positively related to disposable income. This means that when disposable income rises, demand for consumption G&amp;S will also rise, and vice versa. This makes sense since households who have more money to spend will quite likely wish to buy more G&amp;S.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="suranfin-ch08_s03_p06">We can write consumption demand in a functional form as follows:</p>
    <span class="informalequation block"><math xml:id="suranfin-ch08_m001" display="block"> <semantics> <mrow> <msup><mi>C</mi><mi>D</mi></msup><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mover><mrow><msub><mi>Y</mi><mi>d</mi></msub></mrow><mo>+</mo></mover><mo stretchy="false">)</mo><mo>=</mo><msup><mi>C</mi><mi>D</mi></msup><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mover><mrow><mi>Y</mi><mo>−</mo><mi>T</mi><mo>+</mo><mi>T</mi><mi>R</mi></mrow><mo>+</mo></mover><mo stretchy="false">)</mo><mtext>.</mtext></mrow>  </semantics></math></span>
    <p class="para editable block" id="suranfin-ch08_s03_p07">This expression says that consumption demand is a function <em class="emphasis">C</em><sup class="superscript"><em class="emphasis">D</em></sup> that depends positively (+) on disposable income (<em class="emphasis">Y</em><sub class="subscript"><em class="emphasis">d</em></sub>). The second term simply substitutes the variables that define disposable income in place of <em class="emphasis">Y</em><sub class="subscript"><em class="emphasis">d</em></sub>. It is a more complete way of writing the function. Note well that <em class="emphasis">C</em><sup class="superscript"><em class="emphasis">D</em></sup> here denotes a function, not a variable. The expression is the same as if we had written <em class="emphasis">f</em>(<em class="emphasis">x</em>), but instead we substitute a <em class="emphasis">C</em><sup class="superscript"><em class="emphasis">D</em></sup> for the <em class="emphasis">f</em> and <em class="emphasis">Y</em><sub class="subscript"><em class="emphasis">d</em></sub> for the <em class="emphasis">x</em>.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="suranfin-ch08_s03_p08">It is always important to keep track of which variables are exogenous and which are endogenous. In this model, real GNP (<em class="emphasis">Y</em>) is the key endogenous variable since it will be determined in the equilibrium. Taxes (<em class="emphasis">T</em>) and transfer payments (<em class="emphasis">TR</em>) are exogenous variables, determined outside the model. Since consumption demand <em class="emphasis">C</em><sup class="superscript"><em class="emphasis">D</em></sup> is dependent on the value of <em class="emphasis">Y</em>, which is endogenous, <em class="emphasis">C</em><sup class="superscript"><em class="emphasis">D</em></sup> is also endogenous. By the same logic, <em class="emphasis">Y</em><sub class="subscript"><em class="emphasis">d</em></sub> is endogenous as well.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="suranfin-ch08_s03_s01_p04">Autonomous consumption (<em class="emphasis">C</em><sub class="subscript">0</sub>) is the amount of consumption that would be demanded even if income were zero. (Autonomous simply means “independent” of income.) Graphically, it corresponds to the <em class="emphasis">y</em>-intercept of the linear function. Autonomous consumption will be positive since households will spend some money (drawing on savings if necessary) to purchase consumption goods (like food) even if income were zero.</p>

Graphically, it corresponds to the slope of the consumption function. This variable must be in the range of zero to one and is most likely to be between 0.5 and 0.8 for most economies. If mpc were equal to one, then households would spend every additional dollar of income. However, because most households put some of their income into savings (i.e., into the bank, or pensions), not every extra dollar of income will lead to a dollar increase in consumption demand. That fraction of the dollar not used for consumption but put into savings is called the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">marginal propensity to save (mps)</a><span class="glossdef">The additional saving that occurs with an additional dollar of disposable income.</span></span>.

        <p class="para editable block" id="suranfin-ch08_s03_s01_p06">that is, the sum of the marginal propensity to consume and the marginal propensity to save must equal 1.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="suranfin-ch08_s04_p01">Investment demand refers to the demand by businesses for physical capital goods and services used to maintain or expand its operations. Think of it as the office and factory space, machinery, computers, desks, and so on that are used to operate a business. It is important to remember that investment demand here does not refer to financial investment. Financial investment is a form of saving, typically by households that wish to maintain or increase their wealth by deferring consumption till a later time.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="suranfin-ch08_s04_p02">In this model, investment demand will be assumed to be exogenous. This means that its value is determined outside of the model and is not dependent on any variable within the model. This assumption is made primarily to simplify the analysis and to allow the focus to be on exchange rate changes later. The simple equation for investment demand can be written as</p>
    <span class="informalequation block"><span class="mathphrase"><em class="emphasis">I</em><sup class="superscript"><em class="emphasis">D</em></sup> = <em class="emphasis">I</em><sub class="subscript">0</sub>,</span></span>
    <p class="para editable block" id="suranfin-ch08_s04_p03">where the “0,” or naught, subscript on the right side indicates that the variable is exogenous or autonomous. In words, the equation says that investment demand is given exogenously as <em class="emphasis">I</em><sub class="subscript">0</sub>.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="suranfin-ch08_s04_p04">Admittedly, this is not a realistic assumption. In many other macro models, investment demand is assumed to depend on two other aggregate variables: GNP and interest rates. GNP may affect investment demand since the total demand for business expansion is more likely the higher the total size of the economy. The growth rate of GNP may also be an associated determinant since the faster GNP is growing, the more likely companies will predict better business in the future, inspiring more investment.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="suranfin-ch08_s04_p05">Interest rates can affect investment demand because many businesses must borrow money to finance expansions. The interest rate is the cost of borrowing money; thus, the higher the interest rates are, the lower the investment demand should be, and vice versa.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="suranfin-ch08_s04_p06">If we included the GNP and interest rate effects into the model, the solution to the extended model later would prove to be much more difficult. Thus we simplify things by assuming that investment is exogenous. Since many students have learned about the GNP and interest rate effect in previous courses, you need to remember that these effects are <em class="emphasis">not</em> a part of this model.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="suranfin-ch08_s05_p01">Government demand refers to the government’s demand for goods and services produced in the economy. In some cases this demand is for G&amp;S produced by private businesses, as when the government purchases a naval aircraft. Other government demand is actually produced by the government itself, as what occurs with teachers providing educational services in the public schools. All levels of government demand—federal, state, and local—are included in this demand term. Excluded are transfer payments such as social insurance, welfare assistance, and unemployment compensation.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="suranfin-ch08_s05_p02">In this model, government demand is treated the same way as investment demand: it is assumed to be exogenous.

    <p class="para editable block" id="suranfin-ch08_s06_p01">Export demand refers to the demand by foreign countries for G&amp;S produced domestically. Ultimately, these goods are exported to foreign residents. Import demand refers to demand by domestic residents for foreign-produced G&amp;S. Imported G&amp;S are not a part of domestic GNP. Recall from <a class="xref" href="suranfin-ch02#suranfin-ch02">Chapter 13 "National Income and the Balance of Payments Accounts"</a>, <a class="xref" href="suranfin-ch02_s03#suranfin-ch02_s03">Section 13.3 "U.S. National Income Statistics (2007–2008)"</a> that imports are subtracted from the national income identity because they are included as a part of consumption, investment, and government expenditures as well as in exports. Likewise in this model, consumption, investment, government, and export demand are assumed to include demand for imported goods. Thus imports must be subtracted to assure that only domestically produced G&amp;S are included.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="suranfin-ch08_s06_p02">We will define current account demand as <em class="emphasis">CA</em><sup class="superscript"><em class="emphasis">D</em></sup> = <em class="emphasis">EX</em><sup class="superscript"><em class="emphasis">D</em></sup> − <em class="emphasis">IM</em><sup class="superscript"><em class="emphasis">D</em></sup>.

    <p class="para editable block" id="suranfin-ch08_s06_p03">First, let’s define the real currency value, then show how it relates to the demand for exports and imports. The real British pound value in terms of U.S. dollars (also called the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">real exchange rate</a><span class="glossdef">A measure of the cost of a market basket of goods abroad relative to the cost of a similar basket domestically.

The top expression, <em class="emphasis">E</em><sub class="subscript">$/£</sub> <em class="emphasis">CB</em><sub class="subscript">£</sub>, represents the cost of a British market basket of goods converted to U.S. dollars. Thus if <em class="emphasis">RE</em><sub class="subscript">$/£</sub> &gt; 1, then a British basket of goods costs more than a comparable U.S. basket of goods. If <em class="emphasis">RE</em><sub class="subscript">$/£</sub> &lt; 1, then a U.S. basket of goods costs more than a British basket. Also note that <em class="emphasis">RE</em><sub class="subscript">$/£</sub> is a unitless number. If <em class="emphasis">RE</em><sub class="subscript">$/£</sub> = 2, for example, it means that British goods cost twice as much as U.S. goods, on average, at the current spot exchange rate.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="suranfin-ch08_s06_p05">Note that we could also have defined the reciprocal real exchange rate, <em class="emphasis">RE</em><sub class="subscript">£/$</sub>. This real exchange rate is the real value of the pound in terms of U.S. dollars. Since the real exchange rate can be defined in two separate ways between any two currencies, it can be confusing to say things like “the real exchange rate rises” since the listener may not know which real exchange rate the speaker has in mind. Thus it is always preferable to say the real dollar value rises, or the real pound value falls, since this eliminates any potential confusion. In this text, I will always adhere to the convention of writing the spot exchange rate and the real exchange rate with the U.S. dollar in the numerator. Thus references to the real exchange rate in this text will always refer to that form.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="suranfin-ch08_s06_p06">Since the cost of a market basket of goods is used to create a country’s price index, changes in CB will move together with changes in the country’s price level <em class="emphasis">P</em>. For this reason, it is common to rewrite the real exchange rate using price levels rather than costs of market baskets and to continue to interpret the expression in the same way. For more information related to this, see <a class="xref" href="suranfin-ch06#suranfin-ch06">Chapter 17 "Purchasing Power Parity"</a>, <a class="xref" href="suranfin-ch06_s02#suranfin-ch06_s02">Section 17.2 "The Consumer Price Index (CPI) and PPP"</a>.

From this point forward, we’ll mean this expression whenever we discuss the real exchange rate.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="suranfin-ch08_s06_p08">Next, we’ll discuss the connection to current account demand. To understand the relationship it is best to consider a change in the real exchange rate. Suppose <em class="emphasis">RE</em><sub class="subscript">$/£</sub> rises. This means that the real value of the pound rises and, simultaneously, the real U.S. dollar value falls. This also means that goods and services are becoming relatively more expensive, on average, in Britain compared to the United States.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="suranfin-ch08_s06_p09">Relatively cheaper G&amp;S in the United States will tend to encourage U.S. exports since the British would prefer to buy some cheaper products in the United States. Similarly, relatively more expensive British G&amp;S will tend to discourage U.S. imports from Britain. Since U.S. exports will rise and imports will fall with an increase in the real U.S. dollar value, current account demand, <em class="emphasis">CA</em><sup class="superscript"><em class="emphasis">D</em></sup> = <em class="emphasis">EX</em><sup class="superscript"><em class="emphasis">D</em></sup> − <em class="emphasis">IM</em><sup class="superscript"><em class="emphasis">D</em></sup>, will rise. Similarly, if the real U.S. dollar value falls, U.S. exports will fall and imports rise, causing a decrease in <em class="emphasis">CA</em><sup class="superscript"><em class="emphasis">D</em></sup>. Hence, there is a positive relationship between this real exchange rate (i.e., the real value of the pound) and U.S. current account demand.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="suranfin-ch08_s06_p10">Disposable income can also affect the current account demand. In this case, the effect is through imports. An increase in disposable income means that households have more money to spend. Some fraction of this will be consumed, the marginal propensity to consume, and some fraction of that consumption will be for imported goods. Thus an increase in disposable income should result in an increase in imports and a subsequent reduction in current account demand. Thus changes in disposable income are negatively related to current account demand.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="suranfin-ch08_s07_p01">Notice that the right side indicates that if disposable income were to rise, consumption demand would rise but current account demand, which is negatively related to disposable income, would fall. This would seem to make ambiguous the effect of a disposable income change on aggregate demand. However, by thinking carefully about the circular flow definitions, we can recall that consumption expenditures consist of the sum of expenditures on domestically produced goods and imported goods. This was the reason imports are subtracted away in the national income identity. This also means that the marginal propensity to spend on imported goods must be lower than the total marginal propensity to consume, again since imports are a fraction of total consumption spending. This implies that the negative effect on imports from a $1 increase in disposable income must be less than the positive impact on consumption demand.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="suranfin-ch08_s07_p04">Writing the expression in this way allows us to indicate that the spot exchange rate, the price levels domestically and abroad, and domestic taxes and transfer payments also affect aggregate demand. For example, increases in autonomous transfer payments will raise aggregate demand since it raises disposable income, which in turn raises demand. Increases in taxes, however, will lower disposable income, which in turn will lower aggregate demand. Similarly, an increase in the spot exchange rate (as defined) or the foreign price level will raise aggregate demand, since both changes will increase the real exchange rate. However, an increase in the domestic price level will reduce the real exchange rate (because it is in the denominator) and thus reduce aggregate demand.</p>

We begin with a plot of the aggregate demand function with respect to real GNP (<em class="emphasis">Y</em>) in <a class="xref" href="#suranfin-ch08_s08_f01">Figure 19.1 "Aggregate Demand Function"</a>. Real GNP (<em class="emphasis">Y</em>) is plotted along the horizontal axis, and aggregate demand is measured along the vertical axis. The aggregate demand function is shown as the upward sloping line labeled <em class="emphasis">AD</em>(<em class="emphasis">Y</em>, …). The (…) is meant to indicate that <em class="emphasis">AD</em> is a function of many other variables not listed. There are several important assumptions about the form of the AD function that are needed to assure an equilibrium. We discuss each assumption in turn.</p>

    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="suranfin-ch08_s08_p02">First, the AD function is positively sloped with respect to changes in <em class="emphasis">Y</em>, ceteris paribus. Recall that ceteris paribus means that all other variables affecting aggregate demand are assumed to remain constant as GNP changes. The positive slope arises from the rationale given previously that an increase in disposable income should naturally lead to an increase in consumption demand and a smaller decrease in CA demand, resulting in a net increase in aggregate demand. Next, if GNP rises, ceteris paribus, it means that taxes and transfer payments remain fixed and disposable income must increase. Thus an increase in GNP leads to an increase in AD.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="suranfin-ch08_s08_p03">Second, the AD function has a positive vertical intercept term. In other words, the AD function crosses the vertical axis at a level greater than zero. For reasons that are not too important, this feature is critical for generating the equilibrium later. The reason it arises is because autonomous consumption, investment, and government demand are all assumed to be independent of income and positive in value. These assumptions guarantee a positive vertical intercept.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="suranfin-ch08_s08_p04">Third, the AD function has a slope that is less than one. This assumption means that for every $1 increase in GNP (<em class="emphasis">Y</em>), there is a less than $1 increase in aggregate demand. This arises because the marginal propensity to consume domestic GNP is less than one for two reasons. First, some of the additional income will be spent on imported goods, and second, some of the additional income will be saved. Thus the AD function will have a slope less than one.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="suranfin-ch08_s08_p05">Also plotted in the diagram is a line labeled <em class="emphasis">AD</em> = <em class="emphasis">Y</em>. This line is also sometimes called the forty-five-degree line since it sits at a forty-five-degree angle to the horizontal axis. This line represents all the points on the diagram where AD equals GNP. Since GNP can be thought of as aggregate supply, the forty-five-degree line contains all the points where AD equals aggregate supply.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="suranfin-ch08_s08_p06">Because of the assumptions about the shape and position of the AD function, AD will cross the forty-five-degree line, only once, from above. The intersection determines the equilibrium value of GNP, labeled <em class="emphasis">Y</em>′ in the diagram.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="suranfin-ch08_s09_p01">Any equilibrium in economics has an associated behavioral story to explain the forces that will move the endogenous variable to the equilibrium value. In the G&amp;S market model, the endogenous variable is <em class="emphasis">Y</em>, real GNP. This is the variable that will change to achieve the equilibrium. Variables that do not change in the adjustment to the equilibrium are the exogenous variables. In this model, the exogenous variables are <em class="emphasis">I</em><sub class="subscript">0</sub>, <em class="emphasis">G</em><sub class="subscript">0</sub>, <em class="emphasis">T</em>, <em class="emphasis">TR</em>, <em class="emphasis">E</em><sub class="subscript">$/£</sub>, <em class="emphasis">P</em><sub class="subscript">$</sub>, and <em class="emphasis">P</em><sub class="subscript">£</sub>. (If one uses a linear consumption demand function, the <em class="emphasis">C</em><sub class="subscript">0</sub> and mpc are also exogenous.) Changes in the exogenous variables are necessary to cause an adjustment to a new equilibrium. However, in telling an equilibrium story, it is typical to simply assume that the endogenous variable is not at the equilibrium (for some unstated reason) and then to explain how and why the variable will adjust to the equilibrium value.</p>

We project aggregate supply, <em class="emphasis">Y</em><sub class="subscript">1</sub>, to the vertical axis using the forty-five-degree line so that we can compare supply with demand. This helps us to see that <em class="emphasis">Y</em><sub class="subscript">1</sub> &gt; <em class="emphasis">AD</em>(<em class="emphasis">Y</em><sub class="subscript">1</sub>)—that is, aggregate supply is greater than aggregate demand.</p>

        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="suranfin-ch08_s09_s01_p02">We now tell what can be called the “Inventory Story.” When total demand is less than supply, goods will begin to pile up on the shelves in stores. That’s because at current prices (and all other fixed exogenous parameters), households, businesses, and government would prefer to buy less than what is available for sale. Thus inventories begin to rise. Merchants, faced with storerooms filling up, send orders for fewer goods to producers. Producers respond to fewer orders by producing less, and thus GNP begins to fall.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="suranfin-ch08_s09_s01_p03">As GNP falls, disposable income also falls, which causes a drop in aggregate demand as well. In the diagram, this is seen as a movement along the AD curve from <em class="emphasis">Y</em><sub class="subscript">1</sub> to <em class="emphasis">Y</em>′. However, GNP falls at a faster rate, along the <em class="emphasis">AD</em> = <em class="emphasis">Y</em> line in the diagram. Eventually, the drop in aggregate supply catches up to the drop in demand when the equilibrium is reached at <em class="emphasis">Y</em>′. At this point, aggregate demand equals aggregate supply and there is no longer an accumulation of inventories.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="suranfin-ch08_s09_s01_p04">It is important to recognize a common perception or intuition that does not hold in the equilibrium adjustment process. Many students imagine a case of rising inventories and ask, “Won’t producers just lower their prices to get rid of the excess?” In real-world situations this will frequently happen; however, that response violates the ceteris paribus assumption of this model. We assume here that the U.S. price level (<em class="emphasis">P</em><sub class="subscript">$</sub>) and consequently all prices in the economy remain fixed in the adjustment to the new equilibrium. Later, with more elaborate versions of the model, some price flexibility is considered.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="suranfin-ch08_s09_s02_p02">When total demand exceeds supply, inventories of goods that had previously been accumulated will begin to deplete in stores. That’s because, at current prices (and all other fixed exogenous parameters), households, businesses, and government would prefer to buy more than is needed to keep stocks at a constant level. Merchants, faced with depleted inventories and the possibility of running out of goods to sell, send orders to producers for greater quantities of goods. Producers respond to more orders by producing more and thus GNP begins to rise.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="suranfin-ch08_s09_s02_p03">As GNP rises, disposable income also rises, which causes an increase in aggregate demand as well. In the diagram, this is seen as a movement along the AD curve from <em class="emphasis">Y</em><sub class="subscript">2</sub> to <em class="emphasis">Y</em>′. However, GNP rises at a faster rate, along the <em class="emphasis">AD</em> = <em class="emphasis">Y</em> line in the diagram. Eventually, the increase in aggregate supply catches up to the increase in demand when the equilibrium is reached at <em class="emphasis">Y</em>′. At this point, aggregate demand equals aggregate supply and there is no further depletion of inventories.</p>

            <li>Learn about the J-curve effect that explains how current account adjustment in response to a change in the currency value will vary over time.</li>
        </ol>
    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="suranfin-ch08_s12_p01">In the goods market model, it is assumed that the exchange rate (<em class="emphasis">E</em><sub class="subscript">$/£</sub>) is directly related to current account demand in the United States. The logic of the relationship goes as follows. If the dollar depreciates, meaning <em class="emphasis">E</em><sub class="subscript">$/£</sub> rises, then foreign goods will become more expensive to U.S. residents, causing a decrease in import demand. At the same time U.S. goods will appear relatively cheaper to foreign residents, causing an increase in demand for U.S. exports. The increase in export demand and decrease in import demand both contribute to an increase in the current account demand. Since in the goods market model, any increase in demand results in an increase in supply to satisfy that demand, the dollar depreciation should also lead to an increase in the actual current account balance.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="suranfin-ch08_s12_p02">In real-world economies, however, analysis of the data suggests that in many instances a depreciating currency tends to cause, at least, a temporary increase in the deficit rather than the predicted decrease. The explanation for this temporary reversal of the cause-and-effect relationship is called the J-curve theory. In terms of future use of the AA-DD model, we will always assume the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">J-curve effect</a><span class="glossdef">A theory that suggests that after a currency depreciation, the current account balance will first fall for a period of time before beginning to rise as is normally expected.</span></span> is not operating, unless otherwise specified. One should think of this effect as a possible short-term exception to the standard theory.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="suranfin-ch08_s12_p03">The theory of the J-curve is an explanation for the J-like temporal pattern of change in a country’s trade balance in response to a sudden or substantial depreciation (or devaluation) of the currency.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="suranfin-ch08_s12_p04">Consider <a class="xref" href="#suranfin-ch08_s12_f01">Figure 19.6 "J-Curve Effect"</a>, depicting two variables measured, hypothetically, over some period: the U.S. dollar / British pound (<em class="emphasis">E</em><sub class="subscript">$/£</sub>) and the U.S. current account balance (<em class="emphasis">CA</em> = <em class="emphasis">EX</em> − <em class="emphasis">IM</em>). The exchange rate is meant to represent the average value of the dollar against all other trading country currencies and would correspond to a dollar value index that is often constructed and reported. Since the units of these two data series would be in very different scales, we imagine the exchange rate is measured along the left axis, while the CA balance is measured in different units on the right-hand axis. With appropriately chosen scales, we can line up the two series next to each other to see whether changes in the exchange rate seem to correlate with positive or negative changes in the CA balance.</p>

    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="suranfin-ch08_s12_p05">As previously mentioned, the standard theory suggests a positive relationship between <em class="emphasis">E</em><sub class="subscript">$/£</sub> and the U.S. current account, implying that, ceteris paribus, any dollar depreciation (an increase in <em class="emphasis">E</em><sub class="subscript">$/£</sub>) should cause an increase in the CA balance.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="suranfin-ch08_s12_p06">However, what sometimes happens instead, is immediately following the dollar depreciation at time <em class="emphasis">t</em><sub class="subscript">1</sub>, the CA balance falls for a period of time, until time <em class="emphasis">t</em><sub class="subscript">2</sub> is reached. In this phase, a CA deficit would become larger, not smaller.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="suranfin-ch08_s12_p07">Eventually, after period <em class="emphasis">t</em><sub class="subscript">2</sub>, the CA balance reverses direction and begins to increase—in other words, a trade deficit falls. The diagram demonstrates clearly how the CA balance follows the pattern of a “J” in the transition following a dollar depreciation, hence the name J-curve theory.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="suranfin-ch08_s12_p08">In the real world, the period of time thought necessary for the CA balance to traverse the J pattern is between one and two years. However, this estimate is merely a rough rule of thumb as the actual paths will be influenced by many other variable changes also occurring at the same time. Indeed, in some cases the J-curve effect may not even arise, so there is nothing automatic about it.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="suranfin-ch08_s12_p09">The reasons for the J-curve effect can be better understood by decomposing the current account balance. The basic definition of the current account is the difference between the value of exports and the value of imports. That is,</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="suranfin-ch08_s12_p10">The current account also includes income payments and receipts and unilateral transfers, but these categories are usually small and will not play a big role in this discussion—so we’ll ignore them. The main thing to take note about this definition is that the CA is measured in “value” terms, which means in terms of dollars. The way these values are determined is by multiplying the quantity of imports by the price of each imported item. We expand the CA definition by using the summation symbol and imagining summing up across all exported goods and all imported goods:</p>
    <span class="informalequation block"><span class="mathphrase"><em class="emphasis">CA</em> = <em class="emphasis">ΣP</em><sub class="subscript"><em class="emphasis">EX</em></sub><em class="emphasis">Q</em><sub class="subscript"><em class="emphasis">EX</em></sub> − <em class="emphasis">ΣP</em><sub class="subscript"><em class="emphasis">IM</em></sub><em class="emphasis">Q</em><sub class="subscript"><em class="emphasis">IM</em></sub>.</span></span>
    <p class="para editable block" id="suranfin-ch08_s12_p11">Here <em class="emphasis">ΣP</em><sub class="subscript"><em class="emphasis">EX</em></sub><em class="emphasis">Q</em><sub class="subscript"><em class="emphasis">EX</em></sub> represents the summation of the price times quantities of all goods exported from the country, while <em class="emphasis">ΣP</em><sub class="subscript"><em class="emphasis">EX</em></sub><em class="emphasis">Q</em><sub class="subscript"><em class="emphasis">EX</em></sub> is the summation of the price times quantities of all goods imported from the country.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="suranfin-ch08_s12_p12">However, for imported goods we could also take note that foreign products are denominated in foreign currency terms. To convert them to U.S. dollars we need to multiply by the current spot exchange rate. Thus we can expand the CA definition further by incorporating the exchange rate into the import term as follows:</p>
    <span class="informalequation block"><span class="mathphrase"><em class="emphasis">CA</em> = <em class="emphasis">ΣP</em><sub class="subscript"><em class="emphasis">EX</em></sub><em class="emphasis">Q</em><sub class="subscript"><em class="emphasis">EX</em></sub> − <em class="emphasis">ΣE</em><sub class="subscript">$/£</sub><em class="emphasis">P</em>*<sub class="subscript"><em class="emphasis">IM</em></sub><em class="emphasis">Q</em><sub class="subscript"><em class="emphasis">IM</em></sub>.</span></span>
    <p class="para editable block" id="suranfin-ch08_s12_p13">Here <em class="emphasis">E</em><sub class="subscript">$/£</sub> represents whatever dollar/pound rate prevailed at the time of imports, and <em class="emphasis">P</em><sub class="subscript"><em class="emphasis">IM</em></sub>* represents the price of each imported good denominated in foreign (*) pound currency terms. Thus the value of imports is really the summation across all foreign imports of the exchange rate times the foreign price times quantity.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="suranfin-ch08_s12_p14">The J-curve theory recognizes that import and export quantities and prices are often arranged in advance and set into a contract. For example, an importer of watches is likely to enter into a contract with the foreign watch company to import a specific quantity over some future period. The price of the watches will also be fixed by the terms of the contract. Such a contract provides assurances to the exporter that the watches he makes will be sold. It provides assurances to the importer that the price of the watches will remain fixed. Contract lengths will vary from industry to industry and firm to firm, but may extend for as long as a year or more.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="suranfin-ch08_s12_p15">The implication of contracts is that in the short run, perhaps over six to eighteen months, both the local prices and quantities of imports and exports will remain fixed for many items. However, the contracts may stagger in time—that is, they may not all be negotiated and signed at the same date in the past. This means that during any period some fraction of the contracts will expire and be renegotiated. Renegotiated contracts can adjust prices and quantities in response to changes in market conditions, such as a change in the exchange rate. Thus in the months following a dollar depreciation, contract renegotiations will gradually occur, causing eventual, but slow, changes in the prices and quantities traded.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="suranfin-ch08_s12_p16">With these ideas in mind, consider a depreciation of the dollar. In the very short run—say, during the first few weeks—most of the contract terms will remain unchanged, meaning that the prices and quantities of exports and imports will also stayed fixed. The only change affecting the CA formula, then, is the increase in <em class="emphasis">E</em><sub class="subscript">$/*</sub>. Assuming all importers have not hedged their trades by entering to forward contracts, the increase in <em class="emphasis">E</em><sub class="subscript">$/*</sub> will result in an immediate increase in the value of imports measured in dollar terms. Since the prices and quantities do not change immediately, the CA balance falls. This is what can account for the initial stage of the J-curve effect, between periods <em class="emphasis">t</em><sub class="subscript">1</sub> and <em class="emphasis">t</em><sub class="subscript">2</sub>.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="suranfin-ch08_s12_p17">As the dollar depreciation continues, and as contracts begin to be renegotiated, traders will adjust quantities demanded. Since the dollar depreciation causes imported goods to become more expensive to U.S. residents, the quantity of imported goods demanded and purchased will fall. Similarly, exported goods will appear cheaper to foreigners, and so as their contracts are renegotiated, they will begin to increase demand for U.S. exports. The changes in these quantities will both cause an increase in the current account (decrease in a trade deficit). Thus, as several months and years pass, the effects from the changes in quantities will surpass the price effect caused by the dollar depreciation and the CA balance will rise as shown in the diagram after time <em class="emphasis">t</em><sub class="subscript">2</sub>.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="suranfin-ch08_s12_p18">It is worth noting that the standard theory, which says that a dollar depreciation causes an increase in the current account balance, assumes that the quantity effects—that is, the effects of the depreciation on export and import demand—are the dominant effects. The J-curve theory qualifies that effect by suggesting that although the quantity or demand effects will dominate, it may take several months or years before becoming apparent.</p>

            <li>The J-curve theory represents a short-term exception to the standard assumption applied in the G&amp;S model in which a currency depreciation causes a decrease in the trade deficit.</li>
            <li>The theory of the J-curve is an explanation for the J-like temporal pattern of change in a country’s trade balance in response to a sudden or substantial depreciation (or devaluation) of the currency.</li>
            <li>The J-curve effect suggests that after a currency depreciation, the current account balance will first fall for a period of time before beginning to rise as normally expected. If a country has a trade deficit initially, the deficit will first rise and then fall in response to a currency depreciation.</li>

            <li>Learn the determinants of consumption demand and the effects of changes in these variables.</li>

    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="suranfin-ch08_s03_p01">Consumption demand represents the demand for goods and services by individuals and households in the economy. This is the major category in the national income accounts for most countries, typically comprising from 50 percent to 70 percent of the gross national product (GNP) for most countries.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="suranfin-ch08_s03_p02">In this model, the main determinant of consumption demand is disposable income. Disposable income is all the income households have at their disposal to spend. It is defined as national income (GNP) minus taxes taken away by the government, plus <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">transfer payments</a><span class="glossdef">Government expenditures made to individuals or businesses without any good or service received in exchange. It includes social insurance payments, welfare payments and unemployment compensation.</span></span> that the government pays out to people. More formally, this is written as</p>
    <span class="informalequation block"><span class="mathphrase"><em class="emphasis">Y</em><sub class="subscript"><em class="emphasis">d</em></sub> = <em class="emphasis">Y</em> − <em class="emphasis">T</em> + <em class="emphasis">TR</em>,</span></span>
    <p class="para editable block" id="suranfin-ch08_s03_p03">where <em class="emphasis">Y</em><sub class="subscript"><em class="emphasis">d</em></sub> refers to disposable income, <em class="emphasis">Y</em> is real GNP, <em class="emphasis">T</em> is taxes, and <em class="emphasis">TR</em> represents transfer payments.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="suranfin-ch08_s03_p04">In this relationship, disposable income is defined in the same way as in the circular flow diagram presented in <a class="xref" href="suranfin-ch02#suranfin-ch02">Chapter 13 "National Income and the Balance of Payments Accounts"</a>, <a class="xref" href="suranfin-ch02_s07#suranfin-ch02_s07">Section 13.7 "The Twin-Deficit Identity"</a>. Recall that taxes withdrawn from GNP are assumed to be all taxes collected by the government from all sources. Thus income taxes, social insurance taxes, profit taxes, sales taxes, and property taxes are all assumed to be included in taxes (<em class="emphasis">T</em>). Also, transfer payments refer to all payments made by the government that do not result in the provision of a good or service. All social insurance payments, welfare payments, and unemployment compensation, among other things, are included in transfers (<em class="emphasis">TR</em>).</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="suranfin-ch08_s03_p05">In the G&amp;S model, demand for consumption G&amp;S is assumed to be positively related to disposable income. This means that when disposable income rises, demand for consumption G&amp;S will also rise, and vice versa. This makes sense since households who have more money to spend will quite likely wish to buy more G&amp;S.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="suranfin-ch08_s03_p06">We can write consumption demand in a functional form as follows:</p>
    <span class="informalequation block"><math xml:id="suranfin-ch08_m001" display="block"> <semantics> <mrow> <msup><mi>C</mi><mi>D</mi></msup><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mover><mrow><msub><mi>Y</mi><mi>d</mi></msub></mrow><mo>+</mo></mover><mo stretchy="false">)</mo><mo>=</mo><msup><mi>C</mi><mi>D</mi></msup><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mover><mrow><mi>Y</mi><mo>−</mo><mi>T</mi><mo>+</mo><mi>T</mi><mi>R</mi></mrow><mo>+</mo></mover><mo stretchy="false">)</mo><mtext>.</mtext></mrow>  </semantics></math></span>
    <p class="para editable block" id="suranfin-ch08_s03_p07">This expression says that consumption demand is a function <em class="emphasis">C</em><sup class="superscript"><em class="emphasis">D</em></sup> that depends positively (+) on disposable income (<em class="emphasis">Y</em><sub class="subscript"><em class="emphasis">d</em></sub>). The second term simply substitutes the variables that define disposable income in place of <em class="emphasis">Y</em><sub class="subscript"><em class="emphasis">d</em></sub>. It is a more complete way of writing the function. Note well that <em class="emphasis">C</em><sup class="superscript"><em class="emphasis">D</em></sup> here denotes a function, not a variable. The expression is the same as if we had written <em class="emphasis">f</em>(<em class="emphasis">x</em>), but instead we substitute a <em class="emphasis">C</em><sup class="superscript"><em class="emphasis">D</em></sup> for the <em class="emphasis">f</em> and <em class="emphasis">Y</em><sub class="subscript"><em class="emphasis">d</em></sub> for the <em class="emphasis">x</em>.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="suranfin-ch08_s03_p08">It is always important to keep track of which variables are exogenous and which are endogenous. In this model, real GNP (<em class="emphasis">Y</em>) is the key endogenous variable since it will be determined in the equilibrium. Taxes (<em class="emphasis">T</em>) and transfer payments (<em class="emphasis">TR</em>) are exogenous variables, determined outside the model. Since consumption demand <em class="emphasis">C</em><sup class="superscript"><em class="emphasis">D</em></sup> is dependent on the value of <em class="emphasis">Y</em>, which is endogenous, <em class="emphasis">C</em><sup class="superscript"><em class="emphasis">D</em></sup> is also endogenous. By the same logic, <em class="emphasis">Y</em><sub class="subscript"><em class="emphasis">d</em></sub> is endogenous as well.</p>
    <div class="section" id="suranfin-ch08_s03_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Linear Consumption Function</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="suranfin-ch08_s03_s01_p01">It is common in most introductory textbooks to present the consumption function in linear form. For our purposes here, this is not absolutely necessary, but doing so will allow us to present a few important points.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="suranfin-ch08_s03_s01_p02">In linear form, the consumption function is written as</p>
        <span class="informalequation block"><math xml:id="suranfin-ch08_m002" display="block"> <semantics><mrow></mrow>  </semantics></math></span>

        <p class="para editable block" id="suranfin-ch08_s03_s01_p03">Here <em class="emphasis">C</em><sub class="subscript">0</sub> represents autonomous consumption and <em class="emphasis">mpc</em> refers to the <em class="emphasis">marginal propensity to consume</em>.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="suranfin-ch08_s03_s01_p04">Autonomous consumption (<em class="emphasis">C</em><sub class="subscript">0</sub>) is the amount of consumption that would be demanded even if income were zero. (Autonomous simply means “independent” of income.) Graphically, it corresponds to the <em class="emphasis">y</em>-intercept of the linear function. Autonomous consumption will be positive since households will spend some money (drawing on savings if necessary) to purchase consumption goods (like food) even if income were zero.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="suranfin-ch08_s03_s01_p05">The <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">marginal propensity to consume (mpc)</a><span class="glossdef">The additional consumption demanded with an additional dollar of disposable income.</span></span> represents the additional (or marginal) demand for G&amp;S given an additional dollar of disposable income. Graphically, it corresponds to the slope of the consumption function. This variable must be in the range of zero to one and is most likely to be between 0.5 and 0.8 for most economies. If mpc were equal to one, then households would spend every additional dollar of income. However, because most households put some of their income into savings (i.e., into the bank, or pensions), not every extra dollar of income will lead to a dollar increase in consumption demand. That fraction of the dollar not used for consumption but put into savings is called the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">marginal propensity to save (mps)</a><span class="glossdef">The additional saving that occurs with an additional dollar of disposable income.</span></span>. Since each additional dollar must be spent or saved, the following relationship must hold:</p>
        <span class="informalequation block"><span class="mathphrase"><em class="emphasis">mpc</em> + <em class="emphasis">mps</em> = 1,</span></span>
        <p class="para editable block" id="suranfin-ch08_s03_s01_p06">that is, the sum of the marginal propensity to consume and the marginal propensity to save must equal 1.</p>

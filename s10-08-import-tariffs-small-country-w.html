    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch07_s08_p05"><em class="emphasis">Tariff effects on the importing country’s consumers</em>. Consumers of the product in the importing country are worse off as a result of the tariff. The increase in the domestic price of both imported goods and the domestic substitutes reduces consumer surplus in the market.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch07_s08_p06"><em class="emphasis">Tariff effects on the importing country’s producers</em>. Producers in the importing country are better off as a result of the tariff. The increase in the price of their product increases producer surplus in the industry. The price increases also induce an increase in the output of existing firms (and perhaps the addition of new firms), an increase in employment, and an increase in profit, payments, or both to fixed costs.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch07_s08_p07"><em class="emphasis">Tariff effects on the importing country’s government</em>. The government receives tariff revenue as a result of the tariff. Who will benefit from the revenue depends on how the government spends it. These funds help support diverse government spending programs; therefore, someone within the country will be the likely recipient of these benefits.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch07_s08_p08"><em class="emphasis">Tariff effects on the importing country</em>. The aggregate welfare effect for the country is found by summing the gains and losses to consumers, producers, and the government. The net effect consists of two components: a negative production efficiency loss (<em class="emphasis">B</em>) and a negative consumption efficiency loss (<em class="emphasis">D</em>). The two losses together are typically referred to as “deadweight losses.”</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch07_s08_p09">Because there are only negative elements in the national welfare change, the net national welfare effect of a tariff must be negative. This means that <strong class="emphasis bold">a tariff implemented by a small importing country must reduce national welfare</strong>.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch07_s08_p10">In summary, the following are true:</p>
    <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch07_s08_l02">
        <li>Whenever a small country implements a tariff, national welfare falls.</li>
        <li>The higher the tariff is set, the larger will be the loss in national welfare.</li>
        <li>The tariff causes a redistribution of income. Producers and the recipients of government spending gain, while consumers lose.</li>
        <li>Because the country is assumed to be small, the tariff has no effect on the price in the rest of the world; therefore, there are no welfare changes for producers or consumers there. Even though imports are reduced, the related reduction in exports by the rest of the world is assumed to be too small to have a noticeable impact.</li>

        <ul class="itemizedlist" id="fwk-61960-ch07_s08_l03">
            <li>An import tariff lowers consumer surplus and raises producer surplus in the import market.</li>
            <li>An import tariff by a small country has no effect on consumers, producers, or national welfare in the foreign country.</li>
            <li>The national welfare effect of an import tariff is evaluated as the sum of the producer and consumer surplus and government revenue effects.</li>
            <li>An import tariff of any size will result in deadweight losses and reduce production and consumption efficiency.</li>
            <li>National welfare falls when a small country implements an import tariff.</li>

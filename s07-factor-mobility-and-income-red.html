<span class="title-prefix">Chapter 4</span> Factor Mobility and Income Redistribution</h1>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch04_p01">This chapter continues the theme of income redistribution as a consequence of international trade. The focus here is the effect of factor immobility. In the Ricardian model presented in Chapter 2, it is assumed that workers can move freely and costlessly to another industry. In addition, it is assumed that each worker has the same productivity as every other worker in every other industry. This assumption makes it inconsequential if one industry shuts down because, if it does, the workers simply move to another industry where they will be just as productive and will likely earn a higher wage.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch04_p02">This chapter asks, “What happens if free and costless factor mobility does not hold?” The answer is provided by the results of the immobile factor model. This model is helpful for two important reasons. First, from a practical perspective, the model provides a reason why there can be both winners and losers as a result of international trade. Second, the model highlights an important technique used in economic analysis. Because the immobile factor model is identical to the Ricardian model in all but one assumption, the model demonstrates how changes in model assumptions directly impact the model implications and results. This is an important lesson about the method of economic analysis more generally.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch04_s01_p01"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Factor mobility</a><span class="glossdef">The ability to move factors of production—labor, capital, or land—out of one production process and into another.</span></span> refers to the ability to move factors of production—labor, capital, or land—out of one production process into another. Factor mobility may involve the movement of factors between firms within an industry, as when one steel plant closes but sells its production equipment to another steel firm. Mobility may involve the movement of factors across industries within a country, as when a worker leaves employment at a textile firm and begins work at an automobile factory. Finally, mobility may involve the movement of factors between countries either within industries or across industries, as when a farm worker migrates to another country or when a factory is moved abroad.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch04_s01_p02">The standard assumptions in the trade literature are that factors of production are freely (i.e., without obstruction) and costlessly mobile between firms within an industry and between industries within a country but are immobile between countries.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch04_s01_p03">The rationale for the first assumption—that factors are freely mobile within an industry—is perhaps closest to reality. The skills acquired by workers and the productivity of capital are likely to be very similar across firms producing identical or closely substitutable products. Although there would likely be some transition costs incurred, such as search, transportation, and transaction costs, it remains reasonable to assume for simplicity that the transfer is costless. As a result, this assumption is rarely relaxed.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch04_s01_p04">The assumption that factors are easily movable across industries within a country is somewhat unrealistic, especially in the short run. Indeed, this assumption has been a standard source of criticism for traditional trade models. In the Ricardian and Heckscher-Ohlin models, factors are assumed to be homogeneous and freely and costlessly mobile between industries. When changes occur in the economy requiring the expansion of one industry and the contraction of another, it just happens. There are no search, transportation, or transaction costs. There is no unemployment of resources. Also, since the factors are assumed to be homogeneous, once transferred to a completely different industry, they immediately become just as productive as the factors that had originally been employed in that industry. Clearly, these conditions cannot be expected to hold in very many realistic situations. For some, this inconsistency is enough to cast doubt on all the propositions that result from these theories.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch04_s01_p05">It is important to note, however, that trade theory has attempted to deal with this concern to some extent. The immobile factor model (in <a class="xref" href="fwk-61960-ch04#fwk-61960-ch04">Chapter 4 "Factor Mobility and Income Redistribution"</a>) and the specific factor model (in <a class="xref" href="fwk-61960-ch05#fwk-61960-ch05">Chapter 5 "The Heckscher-Ohlin (Factor Proportions) Model"</a>, <a class="xref" href="fwk-61960-ch05_s15#fwk-61960-ch05_s15">Section 5.15 "The Specific Factor Model: Overview"</a>) represent attempts to incorporate factor immobility precisely because of the concerns just mentioned. Although these models do not introduce resource transition in a complicated way, they do demonstrate important income redistribution results and allow one to infer the likely effects of more complex adjustment processes by piecing together the results of several models. (See <a class="xref" href="fwk-61960-ch05#fwk-61960-ch05">Chapter 5 "The Heckscher-Ohlin (Factor Proportions) Model"</a>, <a class="xref" href="fwk-61960-ch05_s17#fwk-61960-ch05_s17">Section 5.17 "Dynamic Income Redistribution and Trade"</a>, especially.)</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch04_s01_p06">Another important aspect of factor mobility involves the mobility of factors between countries. In most international trade models, factors are assumed to be immobile across borders. Traditionally, most workers remain in their country of national origin due to immigration restrictions, while government controls on capital have in some periods restricted international movements of capital. When international factor mobility is not possible, trade models demonstrate how national gains can arise through trade in goods and services.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch04_s01_p07">Of course, international mobility can and does happen to varying degrees. Workers migrate across borders, sometimes in violation of immigration laws, while capital flows readily across borders in today’s markets. The implications of international factor mobility have been addressed in the context of some trade models. A classic result by Robert A. Mundell (1957) demonstrates that international factor mobility can act as a substitute for international trade in goods and services. In other words, to realize all the gains from international exchange and globalization, countries need to <em class="emphasis">either</em> trade freely <em class="emphasis">or</em> allow factors to move freely between countries.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-surantrade-fn04_001">Robert A. Mundell, “International Trade and Factor Mobility,” <em class="emphasis">American Economic Review</em> 47 (1957): 321–35.</span> It is not necessary to have both. Mundell’s result contradicts a popular argument that free trade can only benefit countries if they also allow workers to move freely across borders.</p>

        </ol>

Different degrees of mobility arise because there are different costs associated with moving factors between industries.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch04_s02_p02">As an example of how the adjustment costs vary across factors as factors move between industries, consider a hypothetical textile firm that is going out of business.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch04_s02_p03">The textile firm employs a variety of workers with different types of specialized skills. One of these workers is an accountant. Fortunately for the accountant, she has skills that are used by all businesses. Although there may be certain specific accounting techniques associated with the textile industry, it is likely that this worker could find employment in a variety of industries. The worker would still suffer some adjustment costs such as a short-term reduction in salary, search costs to find another job, and the anxiety associated with job loss. However, assuming there is no glut of accountants in the economy, this worker is likely to be fairly mobile.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch04_s02_p04">Consider another worker who is employed as a seamstress in the textile firm. If the textile industry as a whole is downsizing, then it is unlikely that she will find a job in another textile plant. Also, the skills of a seamstress are not widely used in other industries. For this worker, finding another job may be very difficult. It may require costs beyond those incurred by the accountant. This worker may decide to learn a new profession by attending a vocational school or going to college. All of this requires more time and incurs a greater cost.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch04_s02_p05">Next consider the capital equipment used in the textile plant. The looms that are used to weave cloth are unlikely to be very useful or productive in any other industry. Remaining textile firms might purchase them, but only if the prices are very low. Ultimately, these machines are likely to fall into disuse and be discarded. Looms exhibit very low mobility to other industries.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch04_s02_p06">However, consider a light truck owned and operated by the firm. This truck could easily be sold and used by another firm in a completely different industry. The only costs would be the cost of making the sale (advertisements, sales contracts, etc.) and perhaps the cost of relabeling the truck with the new company name. The truck is relatively costlessly transferable across industries.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch04_s02_p07">Finally, consider the land on which the textile plant operates. Depending on the location of the firm and the degree of new business creations or expansions in the area, the land may or may not be transferred easily. One possible outcome is that the property could be sold to another business that would recondition it to suit its needs. In this case, the cost of mobility includes the transactions costs to complete the sale plus the renovation costs to fix up the property for its new use. Alternatively, the land could remain for sale for a very long time during which the plant merely becomes an eyesore. In this case, the land’s immobility may last for years.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch04_s02_p08">These examples suggest that the cost of factor mobility varies widely across factors of production. Some factors such as accountants and trucks may be relatively costless to move. Other factors like looms and seamstresses may be very costly to move. Some factors like land may be easy to move in some instances but not in others.</p>

<span class="title-prefix">4.3</span> Time and Factor Mobility</h2>
    <div class="learning_objectives editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch04_s03_n01">
        <h3 class="title">Learning Objective</h3>
        <ol class="orderedlist" id="fwk-61960-ch04_s03_l01">
            <li>Learn why time passage is a very important element affecting a particular factor’s mobility across industries.</li>
        </ol>
    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch04_s03_p01">The degree of mobility of factors across industries is greatly affected by the passage of time. In the very, very short run—say, over a few weeks’ time—most unemployed factors are difficult to move to another industry. Even the worker whose skills are readily adaptable to a variety of industries would still have to take time to search for a new job. Alternatively, a worker in high demand in another industry might arrange for a brief vacation between jobs. This means that over the very short run, almost all factors are relatively immobile.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch04_s03_p02">As time passes, the most mobile factors begin to find employment in other industries. At the closed textile plant, some of the managers, the accountants, and some others may find new jobs within four to six months. The usable capital equipment may be sold to other firms. Looms in good working condition may be bought by other textile plants still operating. Trucks and other transport equipment will be bought by firms in other industries. As time progresses, more and more factors find employment elsewhere.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch04_s03_p03">But what about the seamstress near retirement whose skills are not in demand and who is unwilling to incur the cost of retraining? Or the capital equipment that is too old, too outdated, or just inapplicable elsewhere in the economy? These factors, too, can be moved to other industries given enough time. The older workers will eventually retire from the workforce. Their replacements will be their grandchildren, who are unlikely to seek the skills or jobs of their grandparents.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch04_s03_p04">Merely recall the decline of family farms in America. For generations, children followed parents as farmers until it eventually became unprofitable to continue to operate the same way. As the number of farmers declined, the children of farmers began to move into the towns and cities. They went to colleges and often learned skills very different from their parents and grandparents.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch04_s03_p05">In this way, as generations age and retire, the children acquire the new skills in demand in the modern economy, and the distribution of skills in the workforce changes. Labor automatically becomes mobile across industries if we allow enough time to pass.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch04_s03_p06">Consider also the capital equipment that is unusable in any other industry. This capital is also mobile in a strange sort of way. Generally, as capital equipment is used, its value declines. Often the cost of repairs rises for an older machine. Older machines may be less productive than newer models, also reducing their relative worth. When capital depreciates, or loses its value, sufficiently, a firm continuing to produce would likely invest in a new machine. Investment requires the owners of the firm to forgo profits in order to purchase new capital equipment.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch04_s03_p07">Now suppose the firm is a textile plant and the owners are shutting it down. The capital equipment at the firm will suddenly depreciate more rapidly than originally anticipated.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch04_s03_p08">As this equipment depreciates, however, new investments will not be directed at the same type of capital. Instead, investors will purchase different types of capital that have the potential for profits in other industries. In this way, over time, as the current capital stock depreciates, new investment is made in the types of capital needed for production in the future. With enough time, the capital stock is moved out of declining, unprofitable industries and into expanding, profitable industries.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch04_s03_p09">In summary, virtually all factors are immobile across industries in the very short run. As time progresses and at some cost of adjustment, factors become mobile across sectors of the economy. Some factors move more readily and at less cost than others. In the long run, all factors are mobile at some cost. For workers, complete mobility may require the passing of a generation out of the workforce. For capital, complete mobility requires depreciation of the unproductive capital stock, followed by new investment in profitable capital.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch04_s04_s01_p01">The <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">immobile factor model</a><span class="glossdef">A standard Ricardian model with one variation in its assumptions, namely, that labor, the sole factor of production, is immobile between industries within a country.</span></span> highlights the effects of factor immobility between industries within a country when a country moves to free trade. The model is the standard Ricardian model with one variation in its assumptions. Whereas in the Ricardian model, labor can move costlessly between industries, in the immobile factor model, we assume that the cost of moving a factor is prohibitive. This implies that labor, the only factor, remains stuck in its original industry as the country moves from autarky to free trade.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch04_s04_s01_p02">The assumption of labor immobility allows us to assess the short-run impact of movements to free trade where the short run is defined as the period of time when all factors of production are incapable of moving between sectors. The main result of the model is that free trade will cause a redistribution of income such that some workers gain from trade, while others lose from trade.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="fwk-61960-ch04_s04_s02">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Assumptions</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch04_s04_s02_p01">The immobile factor model assumptions are identical to the Ricardian model assumptions with one exception. In this model, we assume that <em class="emphasis">L</em><sub class="subscript"><em class="emphasis">C</em></sub> and <em class="emphasis">L</em><sub class="subscript"><em class="emphasis">W</em></sub> are exogenous. This means that there is a fixed supply of cheese workers and wine workers. Cheese workers know how to make cheese but cannot be used productively in the wine industry, and wine workers cannot be used productively in the cheese industry. This assumption differs from the Ricardian model, which assumed that labor was freely mobile across industries. In the Ricardian model, a cheese worker who moved to the wine industry would be immediately as productive as a longtime wine worker.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch04_s04_s02_p02">Neither assumption—<span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">free and costless mobility</a><span class="glossdef">Factors that can be moved by their owners to another production process without impediment and without incurring any adjustment costs.</span></span> nor complete immobility—is entirely realistic. Instead, they represent two extreme situations. The Ricardian assumption can be interpreted as a long-run scenario. Given enough time, all factors can be moved and become productive in other industries. The immobile factor assumption represents an extreme short-run scenario. In the very short run, it is difficult for any factor to be moved and become productive in another industry. By understanding the effects of these two extremes, we can better understand what effects to expect in the real world, characterized by incomplete and variable factor mobility.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch04_s07_p01">Differences in price ratios are all that’s needed to stimulate trade once the barriers to trade are removed. Since the price of cheese is higher in France upon the opening of free trade, U.S. cheese producers will begin to export cheese to the French market, where they will make a greater profit. Similarly, French wine producers will export wine to the U.S. market, where it commands a higher price. The effect of the shift in supply is to force the price of cheese relative to wine down in France and up in the United States until they meet at a price ratio that equalizes world supply of wine and cheese with world demand for wine and cheese.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch04_s09_p01">When the United States and France move from autarky to free trade, the U.S. price of cheese rises and the United States begins to export cheese. The French price of wine rises and France begins to export wine. In both of these industries, the higher prices generate higher revenue, and since profits must remain equal to zero because of competition in the industry, higher wages are paid to the workers. As long as the factors remain immobile, other workers do not enter the higher wage industry, so these higher wages can be maintained. Thus in both countries <em class="emphasis">real wages rise for workers in the export industries</em>.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch04_s09_p02">The movement from autarky to free trade also causes the price of wine to fall in the United States while the United States imports wine and the price of cheese to fall in France while France imports cheese. Lower prices reduce the revenue to the industry, and to maintain zero profit, wages are reduced proportionally. Since workers are assumed to be immobile, workers cannot flee the low-wage industry and thus low wages are maintained. Thus in both countries <em class="emphasis">real wages fall for workers in the import-competing industries</em>.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch04_s09_p03">But isn’t it possible for the owners of the firms in the export industries to claim all the extra revenue for themselves? In other words, maybe when the price rises the owners of the export firms simply pay the CEO and the rest of management a few extra million dollars and do not give any of the extra revenue to the ordinary workers. Actually, this is unlikely under the assumptions of the model. First of all, the model has no owners or management. Instead, all workers are assumed to be the same, and no workers have any special ownership rights. But let’s suppose that there is an owner. The owner can’t claim a huge pay increase because the industry is assumed to be perfectly competitive. This means that there are hundreds or thousands of other export firms that have all realized a price increase. Although workers are assumed to be immobile across industries, they are not immobile <em class="emphasis">between firms</em> within an industry.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch04_s09_p04">So let’s suppose that all the firm’s owners simply pocket the extra revenue. If one of these owners wants to make even more money, it is now possible. All she must do is reduce her pay somewhat and offer her workers a higher wage. The higher wage will entice other workers in the industry to move to the generous firm. By increasing workers’ wages, this owner can expand her own firm’s output at the expense of other firms in the industry. Despite a lower wage for the owner, as long as the increased output is sufficiently large, the owner will make even more money for herself than she would have had she not raised worker wages. However, these extra profits will only be temporary since other owners would soon be forced to raise worker wages to maintain their own output and profit. It is this competition within the industry that will force wages for workers up and the compensation for owners down. In the end, economic profit will be forced to zero. Zero economic profit assures that owners will receive just enough to prevent them from moving to another industry.</p>

            <li>Understand how national welfare is affected by free trade in an immobile factor model and why compensation cannot assure everyone gains.</li>
        </ol>
    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch04_s10_p01">The real wage calculations show that some workers gain from trade, while others lose from trade. On the other hand, we showed that the economy is able to jump to a higher aggregate indifference as a result of free trade. The increase in aggregate welfare is attributable entirely to an increase in consumption efficiency. A reasonable question to ask at this juncture is whether the winners from trade could compensate the losers such that every worker is left no worse off from free trade. The answer to this question is no in the context of this model.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch04_s10_p02">In the immobile factor model, there is no increase in world productive efficiency. The immobility of factors implies that world output is the same with trade as it was in autarky. This means that the best that compensation could provide is to return everyone to their autarky consumption levels. And the only way to do that is to eliminate trade. There simply is no way to increase the total consumption of each good for every worker after trade begins.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch04_s10_p03">Sometimes economists argue that since the model displays an increase in consumption efficiency, this means that the country is better off with trade. While technically this is true, it is important to realize that statements about what’s best for a country in the aggregate typically mask the effects on particular individuals. The immobile factor model suggests that in the very short run, movements to free trade will very likely result in a redistribution of income with some groups of individuals suffering real income losses. It will be very difficult to convince those who will lose that free trade is a good idea because the aggregate effects are positive.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch04_s10_p04">Furthermore, since there is no way for the winners to compensate the losers such that everyone gains, the model implies that the movement to free trade can be a zero-sum game, at least in the very short run. This means that the sum of the gains to the winners is exactly equal to the sum of the losses to the losers.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-61960-ch04_s10_p05">In the Heckscher-Ohlin model, we will show that income redistribution is possible even in the long run when an economy moves to free trade. However, in that case, free trade will be a positive-sum game in that the sum of the gains will exceed the sum of the losses.</p>
